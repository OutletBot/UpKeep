FIX: Snooze freshness preservation bug for linked tasks

Fixed critical bug where linked tasks would lose their frozen freshness when re-syncing snooze state.

Problem:
- When manually snoozing a task, linked tasks would freeze at their CURRENT freshness
- If a linked task was already snoozed, re-syncing would overwrite frozenFreshness
- This caused freshness to appear to decay during snooze

Solution:
- Only set frozenFreshness on first snooze (when undefined)
- Preserve existing frozenFreshness during re-sync operations
- This ensures freshness stays exactly as it was when first snoozed

Line 3991: Added check to prevent overwriting existing frozenFreshness
