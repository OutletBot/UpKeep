Critical bug fixes: Snoozed task freshness depletion and dust bunny images

SNOOZE BUG FIX (Critical):
- Fixed freshness continuing to deplete for snoozed tasks across ALL completion paths
- Root cause: Auto-snooze was setting snoozedUntil but NOT frozenFreshness
- Added frozenFreshness preservation in single tasks, bulk completions, and linked tasks
- Added migration fix to repair existing broken snoozed tasks on load
- Ensures all snooze operations properly manage both snoozedUntil and frozenFreshness

DUST BUNNY IMAGE FIX:
- Fixed 404 error for dust bunny images on category cards
- Corrected CSS paths from Imag/DUST BUNNY.png to ../Imag/DUST BUNNY.png
- Updated css/main.css and css/main-fixed.css

FILES MODIFIED:
- js/chore-system.js (snooze fixes + migration)
- css/main.css (dust bunny path)
- css/main-fixed.css (dust bunny path)

NEW FILES:
- SNOOZE-BUG-FIX-REPORT.md (comprehensive documentation)

All task types now correctly maintain freshness during snooze periods.
