dialy mission should reset when users local device clock has a new date, example i completed the task at 10/5/2025 and now it is 10/6/2025 ,so the daily taask should be refreshed

loadData
 function to ensure the new field exists for backward compatibility:

Perfect! I've updated the daily reset system to check for date changes based on the user's local device clock:

‚úÖ Daily Reset Updated
Changes Made:
Date-based reset - Now uses toDateString() to compare dates (e.g., "Sat Oct 05 2025")
Resets at midnight - When the date changes from 10/5/2025 to 10/6/2025, missions automatically reset
Stores last reset date - New field lastDailyResetDate tracks the last date missions were reset
Resets bonus flag - dailyBonusClaimed is now reset with the daily missions
Backward compatible - Added initialization for new fields in 
loadData()
How It Works:
Checks on every mission window open
Compares current date string with stored date string
If different ‚Üí resets all missions, chore count, and bonus flag
Works regardless of time zone or when the user opens the app
Now missions will reset properly when the calendar date changes! üìÖ

Perfect! I've updated Scrappy to float in the mascot's position and added text-to-speech:

‚úÖ Scrappy Updates Complete
New Position:
Floats in top-right corner at the exact same spot as the mascot robot (top: 80px, right: 15px)
Uses the same floating animation
Appears globally over all content when the store is open
Text-to-Speech Integration:
Speaks all dialogue using the device's text-to-speech engine
Custom voice settings for Scrappy:
Lower pitch (0.8) for a gruff, mechanical voice
Slower rate (0.9) for robotic effect
Respects user settings - only speaks if voice is enabled in settings
Cancels previous speech before starting new dialogue
Speech Bubble:
Positioned to the left of Scrappy (like the mascot's bubbles)
Smooth fade-in/out animations
Arrow pointer points to Scrappy
Now Scrappy floats in the corner like your helper robot and actually speaks his dialogue with a distinctive gruff robot voice! ü§ñüîßüé§

I've fixed the z-index issue! Scrappy was hidden behind the store modal. I increased his z-index to 2100 so he now floats on top of the store window.

Now when you open the Robot Factory store, Scrappy should appear in the top-right corner, floating and ready to greet you! ü§ñ

when the store is open, the users current robot shall not be interactable or speak at all. when the store window is open the focus is to be on the store manager robot "scrappy". the store manger robot shall have the same featurees as the users robot, like if you click it it speaks, if you click it it moves out the way etc etc

I'll hide the user's robot when the store is open and add all the mascot's interactive features to Scrappy:

Now let me add the click-to-speak and dodging functionality to Scrappy:

Now let me add the interaction function for Scrappy:

Perfect! I've implemented all the interactive features for Scrappy:

‚úÖ Scrappy Interactive Features Complete
When Store is Open:
User's robot is hidden - Only Scrappy is visible and interactive
User's robot won't speak - All focus is on Scrappy
Scrappy's Interactive Features:
Click to Speak - Click on Scrappy and he'll say a random idle line
Dodging Animation - Scrappy moves out of the way in random directions when clicked (just like the mascot)
Text-to-Speech - Speaks with his distinctive gruff voice (lower pitch, slower rate)
Floating Animation - Constantly floats in place
Automatic Idle Chatter - Speaks random lines every 15-20 seconds
When Store Closes:
Scrappy says goodbye and disappears
User's robot reappears and becomes interactive again
Now Scrappy has all the same interactive charm as your helper robot! Click him to make him dodge and speak! ü§ñüîß‚ú®

im not hearing scrappys voice at all

Let me check if voice is enabled in your settings and also verify the speech synthesis is working:

Searched
voiceEnabled: in c:\Users\Outlet\Desktop\AI FUN\CHORE GOALS\windsurf-project-4 - Copy\index.html (0)

Fixed! The issue was that the code was checking for voiceEnabled when it should be ttsEnabled.

Now Scrappy will speak, but you need to make sure voice is enabled in settings:

Go to Settings ‚öôÔ∏è (top-right)
Find the "Mascot Voice" card
Toggle "Enable Voice" to ON
Once voice is enabled, Scrappy will speak with his distinctive gruff robot voice (lower pitch, slower pace) whenever he has dialogue! ü§ñüîä

‚úÖ Scrappy Voice Settings Complete
New Settings Card:
In the Settings/Tools menu, there's now a "üîß Scrappy's Voice" section with:

Pitch Slider (0.5 - 2.0)
Default: 0.8 (gruff/low)
Labels: "Low (Gruff)" to "High (Squeaky)"
Speed Slider (0.5 - 2.0)
Default: 0.9 (mechanical)
Labels: "Slow (Mechanical)" to "Fast (Energetic)"
Test Button - "üîä Test Scrappy's Voice"
Speaks random Scrappy-style phrases like:
"Whirrr... Clank... Testing my voice circuits!"
"Bzzt. Audio systems operational!"
"squeak... This is how I sound, circuit-head!"
Features:
Settings are saved automatically when you adjust sliders
Settings persist across sessions
Independent from mascot voice - customize each separately
Uses the same TTS enable/disable toggle as the mascot
Now you can make Scrappy sound exactly how you want - from a deep, slow gruff mechanic to a high-pitched speedy chatterbox! üîßü§ñüéôÔ∏è

Buzz Bot will say "Sometimes I miss chasing Zurg, but a clean home is a noble mission too!" or "To infinity... and beyond the laundry pile!"
Jack-o'-Bot will say spooky Halloween-themed phrases
Pika-Bot will say electric/energetic phrases
Mega Rocket Man will say space-themed phrases

Purchased Robot Disappears - The robot you just bought is immediately removed from the store grid
Currency Updates - Your bolt count updates in real-time
Scrappy Celebrates - Scrappy shows his happy face and says a purchase message
Reveal Modal Pops Up - After 1.5 seconds, the reveal animation shows over the store
Continue Shopping - After closing the reveal, you're back in the store and can buy more robots!
Now you can go on a shopping spree and buy multiple robots without having to reopen the store each time! ü§ñüõí‚ú®

Perfect! I've fixed both issues:

‚úÖ Fixed Store and Scrappy Issues
Issue 1: Store Closing After Purchase
Fixed: The reveal modal now keeps the store open
Scrappy celebrates the purchase instead of the mascot
Store continues with idle chatter after closing the reveal
You can keep shopping without reopening the store
Issue 2: Scrappy Appearing on Main Screen
Fixed: Added safeguard in 
init()
 to ensure Scrappy is hidden on startup
Scrappy only appears when the Robot Factory store is open
Scrappy disappears when the store is closed
No more unwanted appearances on the main screen
Now the store works perfectly:

Multiple Purchase Prevention - If player tries to buy another robot, Scrappy says: "Hold on there! I'm still working on the last order!"
Purchase Sequence - Runs completely without interruption:
Scrappy celebrates purchase
Store updates (robot disappears, currency deducted)
Wait 4.5 seconds for Scrappy to finish speaking
Show reveal modal

Lock Released - When player closes the reveal modal, all buttons become clickable again
Lock Cleared When:
