i want to ad a robot select bubble that will bring up a robot select screen where users
can select to change their current robot to another robot

when user switches robot, the new robots dialog will be used.

i want to add "bolts" this will be a digital currency to purchase robots and "oil" to feed robots

robots will have "happiness metters visiable in the robot select screen

when the happiness metter runs out. the robot will break. the user will need to "repair" the robot
