Dialogue for Scrappy, the Robot Factory Owner

Here are some speech bubble ideas for your junkyard robot character, Scrappy.
Greeting Speech Bubbles

    "Whirrr... Clank... New customer detected. What can I bolt together for ya?"

    "Welcome to the Factory. Don't mind the rustâ€”it adds character."

    "Need a bot? Or just browsin' the prime scrap?"

    "Bzzt... State your purpose. Or, ya know, just look around. Mind the loose wiring."

    "Come on in! Watch your step, I dropped a box of ball bearings this morning."

Random Speech Bubbles (Idle Chatter)

    "squeak... Must remember to oil that joint. Later."

    "Hmm, this cog would look great on a Mark IV chassis..."

    "Ah, the smell of burnt circuits in the morning. Smells like... progress."

    "Processing... processing... still processing. This thinkin' stuff is hard work."

    "You ever wonder if we're all just spare parts in a bigger machine?"

    "clank clatter Whoops. Butter-servos today."

    "This place ain't much, but it's full of potential... potential robots, that is."

Purchased Speech Bubbles

    "A fine choice! Bolting it together for ya now. Zzzzap!"

    "Sold! One premium, pre-owned... well, one premium robot, comin' right up."

    "Transaction complete. Another creation finds a home. Try not to break it on the way out."

    "It's yours! Warranty void if you... well, the warranty's void. Enjoy!"

    "Bleep-bloop. Purchase registered. I'll use the good rivets for this one."

Canceled Purchase Speech Bubbles

    "Changed your mind, eh? Fine by me. More parts for my next project."

    "Bzzt. Order canceled. Re-routing spare parts to... the spare parts pile."

    "No deal? Your loss. This one had a perfectly good alternator."

    "Purchase voided. Halting assembly line... grrrrind..."

    "Whatever. More for the scrap heap."

Goodbye Speech Bubbles

    "Come back soon! I'm always buildin' somethin' new... from somethin' old."

    "Exit protocols engaged. Watch the door, it sticks."

    "Later, circuit-head. Don't get rusty out there."

    "Transmission ending. Bzzzzt."

    "Go on, get outta here. These robots won't build themselves."
