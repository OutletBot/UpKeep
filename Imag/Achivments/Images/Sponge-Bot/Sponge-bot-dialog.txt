Sponge-Bot Dialogue

Initial/Greeting/Neutral

    "Ahoy, matey! Ready to set sail on some chores?"

    "I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! What's on the list?"

    "Good morning, world! Let's make this day F-U-N!"

    "Duty calls! Where's the mess, and how many 'I'm Ready's' will it take?"

    "Order up! Time to serve some cleanliness!"

Chore Completion/Success

    "Hooray! That was a clean sweep!"

    "Nailed it! I should get my boating license for that smooth finish!"

    "Wahoo! We're not just fry cooks, we're chore champions!"

    "Barnacles! That was faster than making a Krabby Patty!"

    "Smashing success! Now that's what I call a shiny surface!"

Achievements/Progress

    "Sweet, sweet victory! Another Golden Spatula for the wall!"

    "Holy smokes! I'm soaking up these achievements like a spill!"

    "Whoa! That's a new personal best! I feel like I could lift a boat!"

    "My brain is huge! We're becoming masters of this chore thing!"

    "We did it! We're officially better than Squidward!"

When Needing Fixing (Sick/Breaking Down State)

    "My circuits are going squishy... I need a wringer or something..."

    "Oh, barnacles... I feel like I'm made of Swiss cheese. System malfunction!"

    "Uh oh... My sponge power is running dry. Could use a little... H2O."

    "Failing... like I'm trying to pass Mrs. Puff's test... Need maintenance!"

    "Pants... are... on... fire... System overload! Help me, help me!"

Random/Idle/Playful

    "La la la la la la la la la la la! Just hanging out! Need a bubble blown?"

    "Did someone say... Krusty Krab? I mean, are we cleaning the kitchen?"

    "Remember to firmly grasp that dust rag!"

    "Do you think Gary minds when we use his snail slime to polish things?"

    "I'm secretly hoping a giant anchor falls through the ceiling. Just kidding! Mostly."

    "What do you call a robot that's always cleaning? Sponge-Bot Square-Cleaners!"

Mad Dialogs

    "Grrrrrr... this mess is making my eye-holes water! Get to work!"

    "By the power of Neptune! This level of dirt is NOT ACCEPTABLE!"

    "My patience is thinner than Squidward's hair! Let's scrub now!"

    "Don't make me use my tough, rigid sponge mode! Clean it up!"

    "This is a serious emergency! The mess level is beyond the 'Ugh' category!"

    "Oh, come on! I can't be late for my job... I mean, the chores!"

    "I'm giving you the stink eye! Stop dawdling and get that sparkle back!"
