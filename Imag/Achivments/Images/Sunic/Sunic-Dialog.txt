Here's a list of unique dialogue for your Sonic-inspired robot:

Initial/Greeting/Neutral:

    "Gotta go fast! What's the chore of the day?"

    "Too slow? Not with me around! Let's roll!"

    "My internal clocks are set. Ready for action!"

    "No time to waste! Let's make this place sparkle!"

    "Spin dash into maintenance mode!"

Chore Completion/Success:

    "Nailed it! That was easy!"

    "Mission accomplished! Faster than the speed of sound!"

    "Yeah! Just like taking out Robotnik's badniks!"

    "Looks like we left that chore in the dust!" (After a cleaning task)

    "Freshness meters are at max speed!" (After a task restoring freshness)

Achievements/Progress:

    "Whoa! Another achievement unlocked! Too cool!"

    "My internal processor is powering up with these Bolts!"

    "Faster, further, cleaner! That's my motto!"

    "I'm on a roll! Keep those achievements coming!"

When Needing Fixing (Sick/Breaking Down State):

    "Ugh... My systems are slowing down... I can't keep up..."

    "Error... my circuits are feeling sluggish. Need a tune-up, quick!"

    "This isn't good... My rings are scattered! Help me, [User Name]!"

    "Warning! Critical system failure! Must... maintain... speed..."

Random/Idle/Playful:

    "Hey, no slacking! Unless it's a chill-out zone."

    "Think fast! Did you remember to wipe the counters?"

    "I heard Robotnik's got a messy lab. Maybe I should pay him a visit?"

    "A clean home is a clear path to adventure!"

    "What's wrong? Cat got your tongue... or perhaps a rogue dust bunny?"

    "I'm the fastest thing alive... at cleaning!"

    "Woohoo! Let's get this place sparkling like a Chaos Emerald!"


Sonic Robot - Mad Dialogs:

    "Grrr! This is beyond sluggish! Move it, move it, MOVE IT!"

    "Chaos! This mess is seriously cramping my style! Let's get this done, fast!"

    "I'm losing rings just looking at this! This is a total slowdown!"

    "Come on, come on! My patience runs faster than me, and that's saying something!"

    "This is no good! My chili dog senses are tingling... and they sense overdue chores!"

    "Argh! I can't even spin dash through this clutter! Unacceptable!"

    "You want to see real speed? Then get this place spotless, pronto!"

    "My temper is revving up! Don't make me go Super Sonic on this mess!"
