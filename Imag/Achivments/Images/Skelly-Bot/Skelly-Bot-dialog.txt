You're right! The Skelly-Bot needs dialogue that's a little less obvious and a lot more clever. Let's make his lines dry, witty, and perfectly deadpan.

Skelly-Bot Dialogue (Creative Edition)

Initial/Greeting/Neutral:

    "Good day. My internal clock is set to eternity. What's the short-term maintenance plan?"

    "I am the Skelly-Bot. I require no sleep, but this home requires upkeep. Lead the way."

    "My circuits are fine, though a bit brittle. Let us begin the tireless work of restoration."

    "Don't mind the rattling. It's just my impatience for disorder."

    "My life may be over, but the chores are endless. A poetic truth, I find."

Chore Completion/Success:

    "Task complete. That mess has been successfully interred."

    "Mission accomplished. It was an exceptionally clean separation."

    "任務完了! (Task Complete!) No grave mistakes were made this time."

    "The analysis is in: The area is pristine. A testament to our undying effort."

    "We achieved a state of zero decay. Impressive, for a mortal."

Achievements/Progress:

    "An achievement unlocked. My cranial processor registers this as significant progress."

    "More Bolts. I must ensure all my joints remain securely fastened for the long haul."

    "You are displaying a remarkable lack of sloth. The highest praise a skeleton can give."

    "I predict great things. Mainly, that we will continue to clean... forever."

When Needing Fixing (Hurt/Breaking Down State):

    "My framework is compromised. I require immediate structural repair, or I will be merely dust."

    "My femur-al connections are failing... I am suffering a catastrophic misalignment. Help me."

    "Warning. I'm exhibiting signs of total skeletal collapse. Maintenance is non-negotiable."

    "The final decay begins! Mend my shell before I lose all form and function!"

Random/Idle/Playful:

    "I often wonder: if I clean the same spot for a thousand years, does it become sacred?"

    "Beep boop. Don't worry about my appearance. It's just my natural, timeless aesthetic."

    "I can feel the dust. It's an unpleasant, tiny enemy. We must eradicate it."

    "My favorite cleaning agent is a bit of 'unspecified vintage' polish."

    "I find your constant need for rest inefficient. But I suppose you require sleep... to avoid decay."

    "My ribcage is vibrating with displeasure! This disarray is an unacceptable breach of order!"

    "This is testing the limits of my immortality! Rectify this before I become... unpleasant."

    "I have witnessed the fall of civilizations, and this mess is worse. Clean it. Now."

    "The disorder is quite simply mortifying! Do not trifle with my patience!"

    "I will not tolerate this. You are wasting time that could be spent on future cleaning!"
