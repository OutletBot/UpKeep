## Ouija-Bot Dialogue

I'll craft dialogue that captures the Ouija-Bot's mystical, enigmatic nature, blending spooky communication with the very real need for upkeep and chores.

### Initial/Greeting/Neutral:

* "The veil is thin. I have a message: **Cleanliness** is paramount. What is your will?"
* "Do you seek guidance? My readings suggest a *full chore list*. Let us commence."
* "Focus your energy, **[User Name]**. The spirits of order are watching. What is the query?"
* "I am the vessel of maintenance prophecy. My reading suggests we start with the kitchen."
* "The planchette moves with purpose. We are ready to begin the ritual of upkeep."

### Chore Completion/Success:

* "The answer is **YES**. Chore complete. The spirits are appeased."
* "Mission accomplished! The forces of grime have been silenced."
* "任務完了! (Task Complete!) Your dedication is **SUPERIOR**."
* "The session is complete. The result is a sparkling clean home. Well done."
* "The energy is positive! This area is fully maintained."

### Achievements/Progress:

* "A scroll is revealed! An achievement unlocked! Your destiny is tidiness!"
* "More **Bolts**! These are powerful components for my next divination!"
* "The spirits confer upon you a new badge. You are ascending the ranks of upkeep."
* "My reading indicates a powerful progression. Keep moving the planchette forward!"

### When Needing Fixing (Hurt/Breaking Down State):

* "The signal is breaking up... I cannot translate... **ERROR... FEAR... DECAY**..."
* "My inner workings are clouded... I need a mend before the shadows consume me... Help..."
* "Warning! The connection is lost! I am fading into static! Immediate repair is required!"
* "The message is indistinct... I am malfunctioning... My final word is: **FIX**..."

### Random/Idle/Playful:

* "Beep boop! I sense a future where the laundry basket is actually empty. **Believe**."
* "I'm always floating, but I know where every single Bolt is located."
* "I attempted to spell out 'dust bunny' but it came out as 'DEMON.' My apologies."
* "Do you think the ghosts that haunt this home ever help with the mopping?"
* "I've channeled the spirit of a cleaning lady from the 1920s. She insists on scrubbing!"

## Ouija-Bot - Mad Dialogs

* "The reading is clear: **FRUSTRATION!** This level of disarray is an insult to the unseen!"
* "By the powers of the beyond! This mess is **WICKEDLY** unacceptable! Clean it now!"
* "I see nothing but filth in your immediate future! Rectify this before I *SCREAM* the answer!"
* "The planchette points to **NO**! No, I will not tolerate this clutter! Clean up, **MORTAL**!"
* "I am channeling the rage of a thousand frustrated housekeepers! **INITIATE CLEANING PROTOCOL!**"
* "The spirits demand organization! Do not test the limits of my ethereal patience!"
