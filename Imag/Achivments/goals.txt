Objective:

Implement a "Missions" system that allows players to earn the "Bolts" in-game currency. This system will be accessed via a new bubble on the main screen and will feature tasks that reset on a daily basis.
1. UI Components

a. Mission Access Point:

    Implement a new, circular, floating "Mission Bubble" button on the main game screen, separate from the Store Bubble.

    When clicked, this button opens the "Missions Window".

b. Missions Window:

    This is a large modal pop-up that appears over the main screen.

    It should have a clear "X" button in the top-right corner to close it.

    The title at the top should read "Missions".

    The main content area will display the tasks for the selected category. This area should be scrollable if the content exceeds the screen height.

c. Fixed Bottom Navigation Tabs:

    At the bottom of the Missions Window, implement a fixed navigation bar that does not move when the content area is scrolled.

    This bar should contain three tabs: "Daily", "Achievements", and "Daily Mystery Pick".

    The "Daily" tab should be selected by default when the window is opened.

d. "Daily" Tab - Task Item UI:

    Each daily mission should be displayed in its own container or card.

    Initial State: A standard card displaying the mission's description (e.g., "Check In").

    Completed State: When the mission's criteria are met, the card's border should highlight in green, and a button labeled "Claim" should appear.

    Claimed State: After the reward is claimed, the entire card should be greyed out or have a semi-transparent overlay to clearly indicate it is finished for the day.

2. "Daily" Tab - Functionality & User Flow

a. Mission List & Logic:

    The "Daily" tab contains three specific missions:

        "Check In": This mission is automatically completed the first time the player opens the Missions window each day.

        "Complete 2 Chores": This is tied to an in-game action you will define later (e.g., playing a mini-game, cleaning a robot).

        "Complete 4 Chores": As above, requires 4 chores to be completed.

    Task Progression: When a mission's condition is met, its UI state changes to "Completed" (green highlight, "Claim" button appears). The player must manually click "Claim" to receive the reward for that specific task.

b. "Complete All" Button:

    Include a "Complete All" button located at the bottom of the scrollable content area (just above the fixed navigation tabs).

    When clicked, this button will automatically claim the rewards for all missions in the "Daily" tab that are currently in the "Completed" state.

c. Daily Reset:

    All missions in the "Daily" tab must reset every 24 hours. The UI should revert to its initial state for all players.

d. Final Reward:

    In addition to any individual mission rewards, grant the player a bonus of 5 Bolts once all three daily tasks have been successfully claimed.

3. Placeholder Tabs

    The "Achievements" and "Daily Mystery Pick" tabs should be present in the UI but can be non-functional for now. Clicking them can show a "Coming Soon!" message.

4. Player Save-State Integration

This system must be tied to the playerData object to save progress. The playerData object should be expanded to include:

    lastDailyReset: A timestamp to track when the daily missions were last reset. This is used to determine if a new 24-hour period has begun.

    dailyChoresCompleted: A number to track how many "chores" the player has done today. This should reset to 0 with the daily missions.

    dailyMissionStatus: An object to track the state of each daily mission (e.g., {'checkIn': 'unclaimed', 'twoChores': 'incomplete', 'fourChores': 'incomplete'}).

All progress (completing tasks, claiming rewards) must update the playerData object, which should then be saved to storage immediately.
