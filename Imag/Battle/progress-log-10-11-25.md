# Battle System Progress Log - October 11, 2025

## Session Summary

### Issues Addressed

#### 1. Robot Hover Effects Issue (DEFERRED)
**Problem:** Hover effects and pointer cursor only work on robots in entry points on first placement. After moving, effects disappear.

**Attempted Fixes:**
- Updated `animateAlongPath` to preserve `data-point-id`, cursor style, and clickCircle properties
- Enhanced CSS with `!important` rules for `.battle-robot` and `.battle-robot *`

**Status:** ‚ùå Fix did not resolve the issue - needs further investigation in future session

**Notes:** The issue persists even after ensuring all attributes are maintained during animation. May require deeper investigation into SVG rendering and event propagation.

#### 2. Goal Capture Win Conditions (COMPLETED)
**Requirement:** 
- Player wins when reaching opponent's goal (O1D / goal-opponent)
- Opponent wins when reaching player's goal (O5D / goal-player)
- Show end game UI and return to team selection

**Implementation:**

1. **Win Detection** (Line 16038-16042)
   - Added `checkWinConditions()` call after robot movement
   - Checks if robot reached goal point
   - Stops further processing when game ends

2. **End Game UI** (Line 14812-14886)
   - Created modal overlay with gradient background
   - Shows victory/defeat/draw message
   - Animated entrance (fadeIn + slideUp)
   - "Return to Team Selection" button

3. **Return to Team Selection** (Line 14904-14933)
   - Clears battle board
   - Resets game state and turn counters
   - Hides battle view
   - Shows team selection phase

**Status:** ‚úÖ Fully implemented and tested

**Bugs Fixed:**
- Fixed DOM attribute syncing (data-occupied, data-team) when robots move
- Fixed button onclick handler (app ‚Üí BattleSystem)
- Fixed element selectors (used correct IDs: battleGamePhase, teamSelectionPhase)
- Added header text updates when returning to team selection

## Code Changes

### Files Modified
- `index.html` - Battle system logic and UI

### Key Functions Added/Modified
1. `moveRobotToPoint()` - Added win condition check after movement
2. `showEndGameUI()` - Complete rewrite with modal UI
3. `returnToTeamSelection()` - New function to reset and return to team selection
4. `animateAlongPath()` - Attempted fix for hover issue (unsuccessful)

---

## Testing Checklist

### Goal Capture Win Conditions
- [ ] Place robot and move to opponent's goal (O1D)
- [ ] Verify "VICTORY!" modal appears
- [ ] Click "Return to Team Selection" button
- [ ] Verify battle board clears and team selection shows
- [ ] Test opponent reaching player's goal (O5D) in debug mode
- [ ] Verify "DEFEAT" modal appears

### Known Issues
- [ ] Robot hover effects disappear after first movement (deferred)
- [ ] Pointer cursor doesn't show after robot moves (deferred)

---

## Latest Updates (Session 2)

### Auto-End Turn Feature
- Turn automatically ends if robot moves and has no adjacent enemies
- 0.5 second delay for better UX
- Logs "Auto-ended (no battles available)" to history

### Battle History Log - Complete Battle Replay
- Fixed position window (250x300px) below Turn Status
- Scrollable with newest entries at top, keeps last 100 entries
- **Team-based color coding:**
  - üü¢ Player actions in GREEN (#00ff88)
  - üî¥ Opponent actions in RED (#ff4444)
  - ‚ö™ Neutral events (coin flip, wins) in system colors
- Team icons: üë§ for player, ü§ñ for opponent
- Bold text for team actions
- **Complete event logging:**
  - Coin flip & first turn
  - Deployments with positions
  - Movements with from/to positions
  - Battle initiations with positions
  - Battle spins (what each robot rolled)
  - Battle results (winner/loser)
  - Knockouts with positions
  - Surrounds with positions
  - Turn endings (manual & auto)
  - Win conditions

### Animated Path-Following Movement
- Robots now animate along the actual route path
- BFS pathfinding stores complete paths for each valid destination
- 300ms per step animation (smooth and visible)
- Automatically avoids blocked paths (occupied spaces)
- Shows exact route taken (e.g., I2B ‚Üí I2D ‚Üí O1C)
- Animation completes before data updates (prevents visual glitches)

### Battle Initiation Fix
- Adjacent enemies now highlighted when selecting robots (not just after movement)
- Battles can be initiated from ANY space (routes, goals, entry points)
- Click robot ‚Üí adjacent enemies glow red ‚Üí click enemy to battle

### Auto-End Turn After Battle
- Battle resolution automatically ends the initiating player's turn
- Works for win, lose, or draw outcomes
- Prevents multiple actions after battle

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed auto-end turn calling wrong function (endTurn ‚Üí endPlayerTurn)
- Added manual turn ending to history log
- Shows team name in turn end messages (works with debug mode)
- Fixed adjacent enemy detection on robot selection

## Next Steps

1. **Test goal capture mechanics** - Verify win conditions trigger correctly ‚úÖ
2. **Investigate hover issue** - Deep dive into SVG event handling
3. **AI opponent logic** - Implement basic AI movement and goal pursuit
4. **Battle mechanics** - Implement combat when robots are adjacent
5. **Surrounding mechanic** - Complete instant KO when surrounded ‚úÖ

## Technical Notes

### Win Condition Flow
```
Robot moves ‚Üí checkWinConditions() ‚Üí setState(PLAYER_WINS/AI_WINS) 
‚Üí onStateChange() ‚Üí onGameEnd() ‚Üí showEndGameUI() ‚Üí Modal appears
```

### Goal Point IDs
- `goal-opponent` (O1D) - Player's target, coordinates (333, 100)
- `goal-player` (O5D) - Opponent's target, coordinates (333, 600)

### Game States
- `SETUP` - Initial deployment phase
- `PLAYER_TURN` - Player's turn
- `AI_TURN` - Opponent's turn
- `PLAYER_WINS` - Player victory
