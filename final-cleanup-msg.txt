FINAL CLEANUP: Remove remaining tutorial gate checks

Removed last two tutorial references that were missed:
- Removed upkeepTutorialCompleted flag from data initialization (line 31)
- Removed tutorial gate check from showDashboard() function (lines 2245-2249)

All tutorial code is now completely removed from the project.
The app will no longer attempt to show any tutorial on startup.
