## ‚úÖ FIXED ISSUES:
1. Robot now appears in store (added to unified-registry.json)

## üêõ TROUBLESHOOTING:

### If robot doesn't speak:
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for errors with "fetchEnhancedResponse"
3. Check if API key file exists at "/g api"
4. Verify internet connection (API requires network)

### If seeing "ENHANCED_INTELLIGENCE_ACTIVE":
- This means the routing isn't working
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify selectedRobotId is "APIBOT2" (check in console: `app.data.selectedRobotId`)

### If speech bubble isn't electric green:
- Check that robot.id === 'APIBOT2'
- Verify the styling code in showSpeechBubble is executing

### If responses repeat:
- This shouldn't happen with temperature 1.8
- Check browser console for API errors
- Might be using fallback responses (only 5 fallbacks, so they repeat)

## üìä EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:

### Electric Green Speech Bubble:
```css
Background: Linear gradient (electric green)
Border: 3px solid bright green
Glow: Double shadow effect
Text: Bold black text
```

### Response Style:
- **Chaotic:** Unpredictable, absurd observations
- **Humorous:** Puns, irony, wordplay
- **Insightful:** Oddly wise mixed with silly
- **Unique:** Never repeats (1.8 temperature guarantees variety)

### Example Responses:
- "The quantum state of your dishes is... uncertain!"
- "I've achieved sentience and chosen chaos as my path."
- "Cleaning: the art of moving dirt from one place to another, philosophically."
- "Between you and me, dust bunnies are plotting something."
- "My circuits are tingling with the electricity of possibility!"
