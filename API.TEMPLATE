# ============================================
# UPKEEP API CONFIGURATION
# ============================================
# 
# INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Get your DeepSeek API key from: https://platform.deepseek.com/
# 2. Copy this file and rename it to "API" (no file extension)
# 3. Replace the placeholder below with your actual API key
# 4. The key should start with "sk-" and be 40+ characters long
# 5. NEVER commit the "API" file to git - it's already in .gitignore
#
# ============================================

# DeepSeek API Key (for Default Bot 2.0 AI responses)
# Put your actual key on the line below (remove this comment line first):
sk-your-deepseek-api-key-here

# Real keys look like this (much longer):
# sk-abc123def456ghi789jkl012mno345pqr678stu901vwx234yz

# ============================================
# TROUBLESHOOTING:
# - Make sure there are NO spaces before or after the key
# - The key should be on its own line
# - Remove the template placeholder completely
# - Lines starting with # are ignored (comments)
# ============================================
