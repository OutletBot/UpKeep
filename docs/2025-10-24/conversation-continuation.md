# Conversation Continuation - October 24, 2025

## Current State

The battle system is now fully functional with all critical bugs fixed:
- Robot deployment from bench works
- Movement validation prevents exploits
- Team ownership properly enforced
- Win detection is immediate (matches debug mode)

---

## What We Fixed This Session

1. **Deployment System** - Players can now click bench robots and deploy them to highlighted spaces
2. **Movement System** - Robots can only move to valid destinations (no teleporting)
3. **Security** - Players cannot deploy opponent robots
4. **Win Detection** - Capturing the goal now wins immediately

---

## Known Issues / Future Work

### Potential Areas to Review
- **AI Behavior**: Ensure AI follows same rules as player
- **Status Effects**: Verify all status effects work post-fixes
- **Repair Bay**: Confirm knockout â†’ repair bay flow works
- **Turn Management**: Double-check turn ending logic is consistent

### Not Broken (Don't Fix)
- Debug mode functionality (intentionally different)
- First-turn handicap (-1 MP)
- One action per turn limitation
- Surrounding mechanic

## Testing Checklist for Next Session

- [ ] Full game playthrough (player vs AI)
- [ ] Verify all robot types deploy correctly
- [ ] Test movement with different MP values
- [ ] Confirm battles work after movement
- [ ] Verify goal capture = instant win
- [ ] Test repair bay functionality
- [ ] Confirm status effects apply correctly

## Notes for Next Developer

**Important**: All game rules from debug mode now apply to normal battle mode. Don't create divergent behavior unless specifically requested.

**Files to Know**:
- `js/battle-system.js` - Main battle logic (9451 lines)
- `js/robot-database.js` - Robot definitions
- `js/chore-system.js` - Game launcher/hangar

**User's Rule**: "Triple check everything before ending reply" - They want zero regressions.
