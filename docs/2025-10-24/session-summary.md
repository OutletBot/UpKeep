# Session Summary - October 24, 2025

## Critical Bug Fixes

### 1. **Missing `selectRobotForDeployment` Function**
**Issue**: Function was accidentally deleted, causing "not a function" error when clicking bench robots.

**Fix**: Restored complete function at line 4377-4441
- Validates team ownership
- Checks rebooting status
- Validates turn actions
- Handles first-turn handicap
- Calls `highlightSmartDeploymentDestinations`

---

### 2. **Broken Point Click Handling**
**Issue**: `handlePointClick` had duplicate/incorrect logic preventing deployment clicks from working.

**Fix**: Rewrote priority logic (lines 4484-4532)
1. **Priority 1**: Deployment (if robot selected from bench)
2. **Priority 2**: Movement validation (if robot selected for movement)
3. **Priority 3**: Robot selection (if clicking robot with none selected)

---

### 3. **Movement Validation Failure**
**Issue**: `validMoves` array was calculated but not stored, causing all movement clicks to fail validation.

**Fix**: Added storage (line 5336)
```javascript
// CRITICAL: Store validMoves for validation in handlePointClick
this.validMoves = validMoves;
```

---

### 4. **Team Ownership Exploit**
**Issue**: Players could click opponent's bench robots and deploy them.

**Fix**: Added validation in `selectRobotForDeployment` (lines 4404-4418)
- Checks if it's player's turn
- Blocks deployment of opponent robots in normal mode
- Only allows in debug mode with correct control team

---

### 5. **Win Condition Detection Delay**
**Issue**: Win conditions only checked at turn START, not after actions. Player could reach goal but not win until next turn.

**Fix**: Added immediate win checks in 3 locations:
1. **After Movement** (line 5533)
2. **After Deployment** (line 5108)
3. **After Battle** (line 8422)

All three now call `checkWinConditions()` immediately and stop processing if game is won.

## Files Modified

- **js/battle-system.js**
  - `selectRobotForDeployment()` - Restored
  - `handlePointClick()` - Rewrote logic
  - `highlightValidMovementPoints()` - Added validMoves storage
  - `moveRobotToPoint()` - Added win check
  - `deployRobotToPoint()` - Added win check
  - `closeBattleResult()` - Added win check

---

## Testing Results

✅ Bench robot selection works
✅ Deployment clicks execute properly
✅ Movement validation prevents invalid moves
✅ Cannot deploy opponent robots
✅ Win detection is immediate after goal capture

---

## Impact

**Critical**: All fixes restore core gameplay functionality that was broken. Game is now fully playable with proper win detection matching debug mode behavior.
