# Understanding the Freshness System üìä

**[Robot floats near a task card with a freshness meter]**

**Robot Speech (TTS):** *"Okay, now let me explain one of the coolest parts of UpKeep - the Freshness System! This is what makes UpKeep different from other chore apps. Instead of just checking off tasks, we track how 'fresh' or 'stale' each task is!"*

**Speech Bubble:** "Let's talk about Freshness! üåü"

## What is Freshness?

**Freshness** is a percentage (0% to 100%) that shows how recently a task was completed.

- **100%** = Just completed! Perfectly fresh!
- **50%** = Halfway to needing it again
- **0%** = Really needs to be done!

Think of it like **food freshness**:
- ü•ó 100% = Fresh from the grocery store
- ü•ô 50% = Still good but getting old
- ü•¥ 0% = Expired! Time to replace it!

---

## How Freshness Works

### When You Complete a Task

```
Before:  Freshness: 0%  ‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë
             ‚Üì
[Click ‚úì]
             ‚Üì
After:   Freshness: 100% ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà ‚ú®
```

**[Robot celebrates with sparkles]**

**Robot Speech (TTS):** *"When you complete a task, it instantly jumps to 100% freshness! But here's where it gets interesting - it doesn't stay at 100% forever!"*

---

### Automatic Decay (The Magic!)

**[Robot points to a task card showing decay in action]**

After completion, freshness **automatically decreases** over time based on the task's **Decay Time**.

**Example: "Wash dishes" with 1-day decay**

```
Hour 0 (Just completed):  100% ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà
Hour 6 (1/4 day later):    75% ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë
Hour 12 (1/2 day later):   50% ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë
Hour 18 (3/4 day later):   25% ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë
Hour 24 (1 day later):      0% ‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë ‚Üê Time to do it again!
```

**Robot Speech (TTS):** *"See how it smoothly drops from 100% to 0% over exactly one day? That's linear decay! It's perfectly predictable - you always know when a task will need attention!"*

**Speech Bubble:** "Decay is smooth and predictable! ‚è±Ô∏è"

---

## The Math Behind It

**[Robot writes on a chalkboard]**

### Freshness Formula

```
Freshness = 100% - (Time Since Completion / Decay Time) √ó 100%
```

**Real Example:**
- Task: "Vacuum living room"
- Decay Time: 7 days
- Completed: 3.5 days ago

```
Freshness = 100% - (3.5 days / 7 days) √ó 100%
Freshness = 100% - (0.5) √ó 100%
Freshness = 100% - 50%
Freshness = 50%
```

**Robot Speech (TTS):** *"Don't worry about the math - the app does it all for you automatically! I just wanted to show you how precise it is!"*

---

## Visual Freshness Indicators

### Freshness Meter Colors

**[Robot points to different colored bars]**

```
100-75%:  ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà  Green  "Fresh!"
 75-50%:  ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë  Yellow "Getting Old"
 50-25%:  ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë  Orange "Needs Attention"
  0-25%:  ‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë  Red    "Urgent!"
```

**What the colors mean:**
- üü¢ **Green (75-100%)**: You're doing great! Task is still fresh.
- üü° **Yellow (50-74%)**: Task is aging but not urgent yet.
- üü† **Orange (25-49%)**: Getting stale - do it soon!
- üî¥ **Red (0-24%)**: Very stale - high priority!

---

## Category Scores

**[Robot floats to a category card]**

Each category's score is the **average freshness of all tasks** in that category.

**Example: Kitchen Category**

```
Task 1: Wash dishes      ‚Üí 80%
Task 2: Wipe counters    ‚Üí 60%
Task 3: Sweep floor      ‚Üí 40%
                    Average = 60%
                            ‚Üì
Kitchen Score = 60% (Yellow/Orange)
```

**Robot Speech (TTS):** *"The category score shows you at a glance how that whole room is doing! If it's low, you know that room needs attention."*

---

## Overall Home Score

**[Robot points to the big score at the top]**

Your **Overall Score** is the average of all your regular category scores.

```
Kitchen:       85%
Bathroom:      70%
Bedroom:       90%
Living Room:   75%
            Average = 80%
                    ‚Üì
Overall Score = 80% üè†
```

**Special Notes:**
- ‚úÖ **Regular categories** count toward overall score
- ‚ùå **Group categories** (SWEEP/MOP/TRASH) do NOT count
- ‚ùå **Self-Care** does NOT count
- üîÑ Updates automatically every 60 seconds

---

## Freshness Updates in Real-Time

**Robot Speech (TTS):** *"The best part? You don't have to do anything! UpKeep automatically updates all freshness values every minute. So you can watch tasks decay in real-time!"*

**Update Schedule:**
- Every **60 seconds**, all task freshness recalculates
- Category scores update immediately
- Overall score updates immediately
- Dust bunnies appear/disappear based on scores

---

## Frozen Freshness (During Snooze)

**[Robot points to a snoozed task]**

```
üí§ Snoozed Task:
Freshness: 75% (FROZEN) ‚ùÑÔ∏è
Will resume decay in 2h 30m
```

**Special Rule:**
When a task is **snoozed**, its freshness **freezes** at the current value!

- ‚úÖ Freshness stays locked at 75% (or whatever it was)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Decay pauses completely
- ‚ùÑÔ∏è The frozen value is saved
- üîÑ When unsnoozed, decay resumes from that same value

**Robot Speech (TTS):** *"Think of snooze like putting food in the freezer - it stops aging until you take it out!"*

---

## What Happens at 0% Freshness?

**[Robot looks concerned at a 0% task]**

When freshness hits **0%**:

1. ‚ùå Task turns **red** (urgent!)
2. üìâ Category score drops
3. üìä Overall score affected
4. üê∞ **More dust bunnies** appear on category card
5. üòü Robot looks worried

**But nothing breaks!**
- Tasks don't disappear
- No penalties or punishments
- Just visual indicators showing it needs attention

**Robot Speech (TTS):** *"Don't stress if tasks hit 0%! There's no punishment. It's just a reminder that you should probably do that chore soon. Real life gets busy - I understand!"*

---

## Freshness Best Practices

**[Robot gives encouraging tips]**

### Setting Realistic Decay Times

Match decay times to **your actual habits**:

‚ùå **Don't set what you "should" do:**
- "I should vacuum every day" (unrealistic)

‚úÖ **Set what you actually do:**
- "I realistically vacuum once a week"

**Robot Speech (TTS):** *"Be honest with yourself! UpKeep works best when decay times match YOUR real routine, not some perfect ideal!"*

### Common Decay Times by Task Type

| Task Type | Typical Decay Time |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Dishes, wiping counters | 1 day |
| Making bed, tidying up | 1-2 days |
| Bathroom cleaning | 3-7 days |
| Vacuuming, mopping | 1 week |
| Dusting, windows | 2 weeks |
| Deep cleaning | 3-4 weeks |
| Decluttering, organizing | 1-3 months |
| Seasonal tasks | 3-6 months |

### Adjusting Decay Times

**You can always change them!**

If you find a task is:
- Always red/urgent ‚Üí Increase decay time
- Always green/fresh ‚Üí Decrease decay time
- Just right ‚Üí Leave it!

**How to edit:**
1. Click the task card
2. Click edit/pencil icon
3. Change decay time
4. Save changes

## Advanced: Decay Math for Nerds ü§ì

**[Robot puts on tiny glasses]**

**Robot Speech (TTS):** *"For those who love math, here are the exact calculations UpKeep uses behind the scenes!"*

### Decay Rate Calculation

```javascript
// Decay Time in milliseconds
decayMs = decayValue √ó timeUnit

Examples:
- 1 day = 1 √ó 86,400,000 ms = 86,400,000 ms
- 1 week = 7 √ó 86,400,000 ms = 604,800,000 ms
- 1 month = 30 √ó 86,400,000 ms = 2,592,000,000 ms

// Time Since Completion
timeSinceMs = Date.now() - lastCompleted

// Freshness Calculation
freshness = 100 - ((timeSinceMs / decayMs) √ó 100)

// Clamp to 0-100 range
if (freshness < 0) freshness = 0
if (freshness > 100) freshness = 100
```

### Update Frequency

```javascript
// Freshness updates every 60 seconds
setInterval(() => updateAllFreshness(), 60000)
```

---

## Try It Yourself!

**[Robot bounces with excitement]**

**Robot Speech (TTS):** *"Want to see decay in action? Complete a task right now, then watch the freshness bar slowly decrease over time! It's mesmerizing!"*

**Experiment:**
1. Complete a task with a short decay time (like 1 hour)
2. Watch the freshness bar
3. Check back in 30 minutes ‚Üí Should be at 50%
4. Check again in 1 hour ‚Üí Should be at 0%

---

## What's Next?

Now that you understand freshness decay, let's learn about the **Snooze Feature** - a way to pause decay temporarily!

## Technical Details (For Implementation)

### Code References

```javascript
// Main freshness update loop
updateDecay() {
    this.data.categories.forEach(category => {
        category.tasks.forEach(task => {
            if (task.lastCompleted && !task.snoozedUntil) {
                const timeSince = Date.now() - task.lastCompleted
                const freshness = 100 - ((timeSince / task.decayMs) * 100)
                task.freshness = Math.max(0, Math.min(100, freshness))
            }
        })
    })
}

// Runs every 60 seconds
setInterval(() => this.updateDecay(), 60000)
```

### UI Elements to Highlight

1. Task freshness meter (`.freshness-bar`)
2. Freshness percentage text
3. Color changes (green ‚Üí yellow ‚Üí orange ‚Üí red)
4. Category score card
5. Overall score display
