**Button:** "COMPLETE ALL [TYPE] TASKS"

**What it does:**

- Syncs to regular categories (linked tasks)
- Applies auto-snooze to each task
- Shows total bolts earned

[Click Complete All Trash Tasks]
        ‚Üì
Kitchen ‚úì (100%, snoozed 24h)
Bedroom ‚úì (100%, snoozed 24h)

```

### 2. Complete All in Sub-Categories
**Location:** SWEEP, MOP, VACUUM filtered views

**Button:** "COMPLETE ALL [SUBTYPE] TASKS"

**What it does:**
