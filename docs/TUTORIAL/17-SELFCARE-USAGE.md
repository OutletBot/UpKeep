## Custom Tasks

**Currently:** Tasks are predefined

**Future Feature:** Add your own self-care tasks

**Workaround:** Use Activity Log to track custom habits

---

## Tracking Progress

**Daily View:**
- See which tasks done today
- Which groups have bonuses claimed
- Progress toward completing groups

**No Long-term Tracking:**
- Resets daily (not like household tasks)
- Focuses on today's self-care
- Build daily habits

---

## Disabling Self-Care

**Don't want it?**

Settings → Toggle "Self-Care" off

**What happens:**
- Self-Care card hidden from dashboard
- Cannot access self-care tasks
- No bolt earning from self-care
- Can re-enable anytime

---

## Strategy Tips

**Maximize Bolts:**
1. Focus on easiest groups first
2. Stack tasks (e.g., morning routine = multiple physical tasks)
3. Plan day to include self-care tasks
4. Aim for at least 2-3 group bonuses daily

**Build Habits:**
- Use as accountability tool
- Check off as you go throughout day
- Don't stress about perfection
- Start with one group, expand gradually

**Realistic Approach:**
- Not all tasks every day
- Choose what fits your schedule
- Some days will be better than others
- Self-care should reduce stress, not add it!
