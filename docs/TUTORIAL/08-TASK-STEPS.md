# Task Steps (ABC System) 📝

**[Robot floats near the ABC button on a task card]**

**Robot Speech (TTS):** *"Hey! See that 'ABC' button on task cards? That's one of my favorite features! It lets you break down big tasks into smaller, manageable steps. Let me show you how it works!"*

**Speech Bubble:** "Break tasks into steps with ABC! ✨"

---

## What are Task Steps?

**Task Steps** let you divide a large chore into smaller sub-tasks that you can check off individually.

**Think of it like a checklist within a checklist!**

---

## Why Use Steps?

**[Robot shows examples]**

### Without Steps (Overwhelming)
```
☐ Clean Bathroom (feels like a huge task!)
```

### With Steps (Manageable)
```
☐ Clean Bathroom
  A. ☐ Scrub toilet
  B. ☐ Wipe sink & mirror
  C. ☐ Mop floor
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Makes big tasks feel less overwhelming
- ✅ Track progress through complex chores
- ✅ Can stop partway and resume later
- ✅ Visual satisfaction checking off each step
- ✅ Helps you remember all parts of a task

**Robot Speech (TTS):** *"Breaking tasks down makes them feel so much easier! Instead of one giant chore, you get the satisfaction of checking off multiple little wins!"*

└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**[Robot celebrates with sparkles]**

**Robot Speech (TTS):** *"Perfect! Now your task is broken down into clear, actionable steps! You can check them off one by one!"*

---

## Checking Off Steps

**[Robot demonstrates clicking a step checkbox]**

### Click Any Step to Mark It Complete

```
Before:
 A. ☐ Scrub toilet
    ↓ [Click]
After:
 A. ☑ Scrub toilet ✨
```

**What Happens:**
- ✅ Step gets a checkmark
- 🎉 Brief celebration animation
- 📊 Progress counter updates (1/3 complete)
- ⏸️ Main task NOT completed yet (still in progress)

**Robot Speech (TTS):** *"Notice that checking off a step does NOT complete the whole task! You need to check off ALL steps before the main task is done!"*

---

## Completing the Full Task

**[Robot shows all steps checked]**

### When ALL Steps Are Checked:

```
☐ Clean Bathroom
Steps (3/3 complete): ✅ ALL DONE!
 A. ☑ Scrub toilet
 B. ☑ Wipe sink & mirror
 C. ☑ Mop floor
```

**Now you have two options:**

### Option 1: Click the Main Task Checkbox

```
[Click ☐] → ☑ Clean Bathroom
```

**What happens:**
- ✅ Main task marked complete
- 🟢 Freshness jumps to 100%
- 💤 Auto-snooze activates
- 🔄 All steps reset to unchecked (ready for next time)

---

### Option 2: Steps Auto-Reset After Time

If you complete all steps but DON'T click the main checkbox:
- Steps stay checked temporarily
- When freshness decays back to 0%, steps auto-reset
- Reminds you to do the task again from the beginning

**Robot Speech (TTS):** *"Think of steps as temporary checkboxes. They're there to guide you through the task, then they reset for next time!"*

---

## Managing Steps

### Delete Steps

Click **[Delete]** next to any step to remove it.

**Use cases:**
- Step is no longer needed
- You simplified your routine
- Accidentally added a duplicate

---

### Remove All Steps

Don't want steps anymore?
- Delete each step individually
- Or just stop using them (they don't affect the main task)

## Steps Best Practices

**[Robot gives pro tips]**

### Do Use Steps For:

✅ **Complex multi-part tasks**
- "Clean bathroom" (scrub, wipe, mop)
- "Weekly cleaning" (multiple rooms)
- "Meal prep" (cook, portion, store)

✅ **Tasks you often forget parts of**
- "Morning routine" (so you don't skip steps)
- "Pet care" (feed, water, walk, clean)

✅ **Tasks you want to split across time**
- "Organize garage" (can do one section per day)
- "Deep clean kitchen" (can take breaks between steps)

---

### Don't Use Steps For:

❌ **Simple one-action tasks**
- "Take out trash" (just do it!)
- "Water plants" (doesn't need breaking down)

❌ **Tasks where order doesn't matter**
- If you can do parts in any order, steps might be overkill

❌ **Over-complicated routines**
- Don't make 20 steps for everything
- Keep it simple and actually use it!

**Robot Speech (TTS):** *"Steps are a tool, not a requirement! Only use them if they genuinely help you. Some tasks are fine without them!"*

---

## Steps vs Regular Tasks

**[Robot compares two approaches]**

### Option A: One Task with Steps
```
☐ Clean Bathroom
  A. ☐ Scrub toilet
  B. ☐ Wipe sink
  C. ☐ Mop floor
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ All in one place
- ✅ Single freshness meter
- ✅ One task to track

**Cons:**
- ❌ Can't track parts separately
- ❌ All or nothing completion

---

### Option B: Multiple Separate Tasks
```
☐ Scrub toilet (Decay: 1 week)
☐ Wipe bathroom sink (Decay: 3 days)
☐ Mop bathroom floor (Decay: 1 week)
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Independent freshness tracking
- ✅ Different decay times possible
- ✅ Can complete parts independently

**Cons:**
- ❌ More clutter in task list
- ❌ Three tasks to manage

**Robot Speech (TTS):** *"There's no right answer! Choose what works for YOUR brain and YOUR cleaning style!"*

---

## Steps and Freshness

**Important:** Steps do NOT affect freshness directly!

```
Main Task: "Clean Bathroom" - 45% freshness
Steps: 2/3 complete

Freshness is still 45%!
(Only completing the MAIN task changes freshness)
```

**Why?**
- Steps are guidance, not independent tasks
- Main task controls the decay timer
- Steps reset after each full completion

**Robot Speech (TTS):** *"Think of steps as a recipe. Following the recipe doesn't mean the dish is done - you need to finish cooking to mark it complete!"*

---

## Technical Notes

### Step Storage

Steps are stored in the task object:
```javascript
task = {
    id: 12345,
    name: "Clean Bathroom",
    freshness: 45,
    steps: [
        { id: 1, description: "Scrub toilet", completed: true },
        { id: 2, description: "Wipe sink & mirror", completed: false },
        { id: 3, description: "Mop floor", completed: false }
    ]
}
```

### Step Progress Calculation

```javascript
completedSteps = task.steps.filter(s => s.completed).length
totalSteps = task.steps.length
progress = `${completedSteps}/${totalSteps} complete`
```

### Step Reset on Task Completion

```javascript
if (taskCompleted) {
    task.steps.forEach(step => {
        step.completed = false // Reset all steps
    })
}
```

### Code References

```javascript
// Show add step modal
showAddStepModal(taskId) {
    // Open modal, populate with existing steps
    // Allow adding/deleting steps
}

// Toggle step completion
toggleStep(taskId, stepId) {
    const task = findTask(taskId)
    const step = task.steps.find(s => s.id === stepId)
    step.completed = !step.completed
    
    // Check if all steps complete
    const allComplete = task.steps.every(s => s.completed)
    if (allComplete) {
        showStepsCompleteMessage()
    }
}

// Reset steps on task completion
if (taskCompleted && task.steps) {
    task.steps.forEach(step => step.completed = false)
}
```
