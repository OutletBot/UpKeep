## Implementation Notes

### Tutorial Content Format
Each tutorial file includes:
- **User-Facing Content**: Clear, friendly explanations with examples
- **Visual Aids**: ASCII art diagrams showing UI elements
- **Tips & Best Practices**: Helpful hints for users
- **Technical Details Section**: Implementation notes for developers

### Technical Integration Needed
After all MD files are created, we'll need to:
1. Create tutorial overlay system (UI layer)
2. Integrate with existing app code
3. Add tutorial state management (localStorage)
4. Implement interactive highlighting
5. Add skip/restart functionality

### Design Principles
- âœ… **User-Friendly**: Simple language, no jargon
- âœ… **Visual**: Diagrams and examples throughout
- âœ… **Interactive**: Users try features as they learn
- âœ… **Skippable**: Can exit and return anytime
- âœ… **Comprehensive**: Covers every feature

---

## Next Steps

**Continue creating MD files step-by-step:**
1. Review completed files (01-03) for accuracy
2. Create 04-ADDING-TASKS.md next
3. Then 05-COMPLETING-TASKS.md
4. Continue through the list methodically

**After all MD files are complete:**
1. Design tutorial overlay system UI
2. Code the tutorial engine
3. Integrate with existing app
4. Test user flow
5. Polish and deploy

## Feedback & Iteration

As we create each file:
- Verify accuracy against actual code
- Ensure clear explanations
- Add helpful visuals
- Include technical implementation notes
- Check consistency across files
