## How to Earn Bolts

**[Robot lists all earning methods]**

### Method 1: Complete Tasks (Automatic)

**Currently:** Task completion doesn't earn bolts directly

**Why:** Prevents grinding/gaming the system

**Focus:** Intrinsic motivation + missions

---

### Method 2: Daily Missions (Primary Source)

**Check-In Mission:**
- Open app daily
- Claim check-in reward
- **Earns: 10 bolts**

**Complete 2 Chores:**
- Complete any 2 tasks
- **Earns: 15 bolts**

**Complete 4 Chores:**
- Complete any 4 tasks
- **Earns: 25 bolts**

**Daily Total:** Up to 50 bolts per day!

**Robot Speech (TTS):** *"Daily missions are your main source of bolts! Do them every day and you'll have plenty to spend!"*

---

### Method 3: Self-Care Tasks

**Daily Earning:**
- Each self-care task: **2 bolts** (once per day)
- Complete all tasks in a group: **15 bonus bolts**

**Example:**
```
Physical Health Group (5 tasks):
  - Complete each task: 5 √ó 2 = 10 bolts
  - Complete all 5: +15 bonus bolts
  Total: 25 bolts per group per day!
```

**Robot Speech (TTS):** *"Self-care is important! The app rewards you with bolts for taking care of yourself too!"*

---

### Method 4: Achievements/Streaks (Future)

**Planned:** Additional bolt sources

**Examples:**
- Maintain 7-day streak: 50 bolts
- Complete 100 total tasks: 100 bolts
- Reach 95% overall score: 75 bolts

---

### Method 5: Mystery Game Prizes

**How it works:**
- Mystery game can award bolts
- Random prize (could be robot or bolts)
- If you win bolts: Usually 50 bolts
- Alternative if you already own all robots
