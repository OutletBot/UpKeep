# Completing Tasks ✅

**[Robot floats excitedly near the task checkbox]**

**Robot Speech (TTS):** *"This is the moment I've been waiting for! Let's mark your first task as complete and watch the magic happen! When you click that checkbox, the freshness will jump to 100% and I'll celebrate with you!"*

**Speech Bubble:** "Let's complete your first task! So exciting! 🎉"

---

## The Moment of Truth!

You've created a task. Now let's complete it and see the freshness system in action!

**[Task card gets highlighted with spotlight effect]**
**[Robot moves to hover near the checkbox]**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ┌───────────────────────────────┐  │
│  │ ☐ ← CLICK HERE!              │  │
│  │   Wash dishes                 │  │
│  │ Last: Never                   │  │
│  │ Decay: 1 day                  │  │

│  └───────────────────────────────┘  │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

       └─── [Animated pulsing arrow from robot]
```

**Robot Speech (TTS):** *"See that checkbox? Click it to mark the task as complete! Go ahead, don't be shy!"*

**Speech Bubble:** "Click the checkbox! ☑️"

## Click the Checkbox!

When you click the checkbox, several amazing things happen:

**[Wait for user to click]**

## 🎉 CELEBRATION TIME! 🎉

**[Robot celebrates with big animation]**
**[Confetti explodes from the task card]**
**[Freshness bar rapidly fills to 100% with green color]**
**[Sound effect: Success "ding!"]**

**Robot Speech (TTS):** *"WOOHOO! You did it! Look at that - the freshness jumped to 100%! The bar is completely green! This means the task is freshly completed. I'm so proud of you!"*

**Speech Bubble:** "Amazing! 100% Freshness! You're doing great! ⭐"

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ┌───────────────────────────────┐  │
│  │ ☑ Wash dishes            ✨   │  │
│  │ Last: Just now                │  │
│  │ Decay: 1 day                  │  │
│  │ Freshness: 100% ████████████  │  │ ← FULL GREEN!
│  │                               │  │

│  └───────────────────────────────┘  │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## What Just Happened?

**[Robot calms down, moves to side of task card]**

**Robot Speech (TTS):** *"Let me explain what just happened! When you completed the task, a bunch of cool things triggered at once!"*

**Speech Bubble:** "Let me explain! 📚"

### 1. ✅ Checkmark Appeared
The empty checkbox turned into a checkmark, showing the task is done!

### 2. 🟢 Freshness Hit 100%
The freshness meter filled up completely and turned green. This task is now perfectly fresh!

### 3. 📅 "Last Completed" Updated
The card now shows "Just now" for when you last did this chore.

### 4. 💤 Auto-Snooze Activated!
**This is a special feature!**

**[Robot bounces excitedly]**

**Robot Speech (TTS):** *"Did you notice the task got auto-snoozed? This is one of my favorite features! When you complete a task, it automatically pauses for a short time so you don't have to worry about it immediately. For a daily task like this, it snoozes for 3 hours!"*

**Speech Bubble:** "Auto-snooze keeps you sane! 😌"

**Auto-Snooze Rules:**
- **Daily tasks** (≤24hr decay) → 3-hour snooze
- **Weekly tasks** (>24hr, <1wk) → 8-hour snooze
- **Long-term tasks** (≥1 week) → 24-hour snooze

**Why auto-snooze?**
- Prevents task from immediately starting to decay
- Gives you breathing room
- Reduces notification fatigue
- You can still manually resume if needed

---

## The Freshness Decay Cycle

**[Robot creates an animated diagram in the air]**

**Robot Speech (TTS):** *"Now here's how the freshness system works over time. It's like a countdown timer, but visual and motivating!"*

**Speech Bubble:** "Watch how freshness decays! ⏰"

### Timeline Example: "Wash Dishes" (1 day decay)

```
Hour 0:  ████████████ 100% ← Just completed!
         (Snoozed for 3 hours)

Hour 3:  ████████████ 100% ← Snooze ends, decay begins

Hour 6:  ██████████░░  87% ← Still pretty fresh

Hour 12: ██████░░░░░░  50% ← Halfway there

Hour 18: ████░░░░░░░░  25% ← Getting stale!

Hour 24: ░░░░░░░░░░░░   0% ← Time to do it again!
```

**What This Means:**
- Task starts at 100% when you complete it
- Stays at 100% during auto-snooze period
- Then gradually decays to 0% over the decay time
- At 0%, the task is "due" again
- You can complete it anytime - doesn't have to hit 0%!

**[Robot looks encouraging]**

**Robot Speech (TTS):** *"The cool part? You don't have to wait for it to hit zero! You can complete tasks whenever you want. Lower freshness just means it's been longer since you did it."*

**Speech Bubble:** "Complete anytime you want! 🎯"

---

## Category Score Update

**[Robot floats to show the category score]**

**Robot Speech (TTS):** *"Hey, look up at your category score! It probably went up because you completed a task! Categories show the average freshness of all their tasks."*

**Speech Bubble:** "Your category score improved! 📈"

```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│  Kitchen        50%     │ ← Was 0%, now 50%!
│  ██████░░░░░░░░         │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

**Why 50% and not 100%?**
- Category score = average of ALL task freshness
- You only have one task at 100%
- If you had more tasks at 0%, the average would be lower
- Complete more tasks to raise the category score!

---

## Try Completing Again!

**[Robot gets excited]**

**Robot Speech (TTS):** *"Wait, there's more! Try clicking the checkbox again - you can toggle it off and on. Watch what happens!"*

**Speech Bubble:** "Try clicking again! 🔄"

### Click the Checkbox Again (Uncheck)

**[If user clicks checkbox again]**

```
☑ → ☐  (Checkmark disappears)
```

**What Happens:**
- Freshness returns to what it was before completion
- "Last Completed" time gets restored
- Auto-snooze is removed
- This is like an "undo" feature!

**[Robot looks thoughtful]**

**Robot Speech (TTS):** *"This undo feature is handy if you accidentally complete a task! But normally, you'll just leave it checked. The task will stay at 100% during the snooze, then start decaying naturally."*

**Speech Bubble:** "Undo if you misclick! 👍"

---

## Your Robot's Reaction

**[Robot's expression changes based on overall score]**

**Robot Speech (TTS):** *"Oh, and did you notice? My facial expression changes based on your home's overall cleanliness score! When you complete tasks and scores go up, I get happier! When scores drop, I look more concerned. I'm always cheering you on!"*

**Speech Bubble:** "I react to your progress! 😊"

**Robot Moods:**
- 😊 **Happy** (90-100%) - "You're doing amazing!"
- 🙂 **Content** (75-89%) - "Looking good!"
- 😐 **Neutral** (50-74%) - "Could use some attention"
- 😟 **Concerned** (Below 50%) - "Need some help?"

## What's Next?

Now you understand the core mechanic of UpKeep! Tasks decay over time, and you complete them to refresh them. But there's so much more to learn:

- How to adjust decay times
- The snooze feature in depth
- Breaking tasks into steps
- And more!

**[Robot floats happily]**

**Robot Speech (TTS):** *"You're doing great! Next, I'll explain the freshness system in more detail so you really understand what's happening behind the scenes!"*

**Speech Bubble:** "Next up: Understanding freshness! 📊"

```

### Code Integration Points
- `toggleTask()` function - Detect task completion
- Trigger celebration animation on freshness change to 100%
- Monitor category score updates
- Show auto-snooze notification
- Update tutorial state

### Special Animations
- **Big Celebration**: Larger confetti burst, robot jumps higher
- **Progress Bar Animation**: Smooth fill from 0% to 100% (300ms ease-out)
- **Checkmark Animation**: Scale bounce effect
- **Category Score**: Number count-up animation

### Audio Cues (Optional)
- Success "ding" sound on task completion
- Cheerful chime during celebration
- Soft "whoosh" for robot movement
