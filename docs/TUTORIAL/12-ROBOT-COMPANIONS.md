### Robot Data Structure

```javascript
robot = {
    id: 'VOLTBOT',
    name: 'Volt-Bot',
    cost: 120,
    happyImage: 'path/to/happy.png',
    sadImage: 'path/to/sad.png',
    thinkingImage: 'path/to/thinking.png',
    hasCustomDialogue: true,

        lowScore: ["Let's tackle this together!"]
    }
}
```

### Battery Mechanics

```javascript
// Battery drain per task
drainBattery(robotId, amount = 0.5) {
    if (!this.data.robotBonds[robotId]) return
    const bond = this.data.robotBonds[robotId]
    if (bond.durability.solar) return // Solar powered
    
    bond.durability.battery -= amount
    if (bond.durability.battery <= 0) {
        bond.durability.battery = 0
        bond.durability.isBroken = true
    }
}

// Check if robot is active
const isActive = robotId === this.data.selectedRobotId
const decayRate = isActive ? activeRate : (activeRate / 4)
```

### Robot Selection

```javascript
selectRobot(robotId) {
    this.data.selectedRobotId = robotId
    this.saveData()
    this.loadSelectedRobot() // Update mascot image
    this.renderRobotOptions() // Update UI
}
```
