I want to make "Sub Catagorys"
Sweep/Mop
Shampoo
Vacume
Trash

these catagorys shall not have decay bar nor effect over all upkeep score.
task withen these sub catagorys will be directly linked to regular catagorys and will have decay bars as normal

so for example

If user makes trash sub-category
withen the sub-catagory to add task, you must select from exciting catagorys in the "trash category task" drop down menu.

the menu will populated by the exciting regular catagories the user has set up.

so if the user add (example) "Kitchen" from the drop down menu in this sub-category it will be listed in the sub category as "Trash - Kitchen"


this task will also be populated to the exciting kitchen category.the user should also be required to enter a decay time for this task, but the decay should only effect the category it is linked to, not the sub category. 
 ( it should be uniquely indintified as sub-category task withen)
when user checks off task it shall be completed in both kitchen category and the sub category at the same time.
