# 🛡️ Anti-Cheat System - Bolt Rewards Protection

**Date**: November 1, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED

---

## 🎯 Overview

Comprehensive anti-cheat measures to prevent exploiting the bolt reward system while maintaining a fair and enjoyable experience for legitimate users.

---

## 🔒 Protection Mechanisms

### 1. **Task Completion Protection**

**Problem**: Users could spam-click tasks to earn bolts repeatedly  
**Solution**: Multi-layer validation

```javascript
// Only award bolts if:
1. Task freshness was < 100 (genuine completion)
2. At least 1 minute has passed since last bolt reward
3. Task is actually being completed (not just clicked)
```

**Implementation**:
- Track `task.lastBoltReward` timestamp
- Minimum 60-second cooldown between rewards
- Check `wasIncomplete` before awarding

**User Impact**: ✅ None for normal use (tasks decay slower than 1 minute)

---

### 2. **Category Completion Bonus Protection**

**Problem**: Users could complete/uncomplete tasks to farm category bonuses  
**Solution**: Daily cooldown per category

```javascript
// Only award category bonus if:
1. All tasks in category are 100% fresh
2. At least 24 hours since last category bonus
3. Bonus tracked per category
```

**Implementation**:
- Track `category.lastCategoryBonus` timestamp
- 24-hour cooldown per category
- First-time bonus tracked separately

**User Impact**: ✅ Minimal - encourages maintaining categories, not farming them

---

### 3. **Streak Milestone Protection**

**Problem**: Streak milestones already protected by gamification system  
**Solution**: Built-in protection

```javascript
// Gamification.checkStreakMilestone() ensures:
1. Milestone only triggers once per streak level
2. Tracked via streaks.lastMilestoneShown
3. Cannot be re-triggered without genuine streak progress
```

**User Impact**: ✅ None - works as designed

---

### 4. **Self-Care Task Protection**

**Problem**: Users could complete tasks multiple times per day  
**Solution**: Daily earning flag

```javascript
// Only award bolts if:
1. Task is completed
2. task.earnedToday is false
3. Flag resets at midnight
```

**Implementation**:
- Track `task.earnedToday` boolean
- Reset daily via `resetDailyFlags()`
- Visual indicator shows "✓ +10 bolts earned"

**User Impact**: ✅ None - designed for once-per-day completion

---

## 📊 Cooldown Timers

| Reward Type | Cooldown | Reason |
|-------------|----------|--------|
| **Task completion** | 1 minute | Prevent rapid clicking |
| **Category bonus** | 24 hours | Prevent farming |
| **Streak milestone** | Once per level | Natural progression |
| **Self-care task** | 24 hours | Daily design |
| **Self-care group** | 24 hours | Daily design |

---

## 🧪 Edge Cases Handled

### **Rapid Task Clicking**
- ✅ 1-minute cooldown prevents spam
- ✅ Freshness check ensures genuine completion
- ✅ No bolts awarded if task already at 100%

### **Category Farming**
- ✅ 24-hour cooldown per category
- ✅ Can't uncomplete/recomplete for bonus
- ✅ First-time bonus only awarded once ever

### **Time Manipulation**
- ⚠️ Client-side timestamps (localStorage)
- 🔮 Future: Server-side validation if needed
- 💡 Current: Acceptable for single-player app

### **Manual Currency Editing**
- ⚠️ Users can edit localStorage directly
- 💭 Philosophy: Single-player game, user's choice
- 🎮 Similar to cheat codes in offline games

---

## 🎮 Design Philosophy

### **Trust-Based System**
This is a **personal productivity app**, not a competitive game:
- Users who cheat only hurt themselves
- Focus on **positive reinforcement**, not punishment
- Anti-cheat prevents **accidental** exploitation, not determined hackers

### **Gentle Protection**
- Cooldowns are **reasonable** (1 min, 24 hours)
- No harsh penalties or error messages
- Silent prevention - just doesn't award bolts
- Maintains **smooth user experience**

### **Future-Proof**
If multiplayer features are added:
- Server-side validation can be implemented
- Cryptographic signatures for rewards
- Rate limiting on backend
- Audit logs for suspicious activity

---

## 🔍 What's NOT Protected

### **Intentional Gaps**

1. **Manual localStorage Editing**
   - Users can edit `currency` directly
   - Decision: This is their personal app
   - Impact: Only affects their own experience

2. **System Clock Manipulation**
   - Users can change device time
   - Decision: Too invasive to prevent
   - Impact: Breaks their own streaks/timers

3. **Browser DevTools**
   - Users can call functions directly
   - Decision: Requires technical knowledge
   - Impact: If they can do this, they earned it

## 📝 Implementation Details

### **Files Modified**

**`js/chore-system.js`**:
```javascript
// Task completion (line ~4256)
- Added wasIncomplete check
- Added lastBoltReward tracking
- Added 60-second cooldown

// Category bonus (line ~4217)
- Added lastCategoryBonus tracking
- Added 24-hour cooldown
- Saves data after awarding

// Self-care (existing)
- Uses earnedToday flag
- Resets daily
```

### **Data Structure Changes**

```javascript
// Task object additions
task.lastBoltReward = timestamp;  // When bolts were last awarded

// Category object additions
category.lastCategoryBonus = timestamp;  // When bonus was last awarded
category.firstCompletionAwarded = boolean;  // First-time bonus claimed

// Self-care task (existing)
task.earnedToday = boolean;  // Reset daily
```

- [x] Complete same task again immediately → No bolts (cooldown)
- [x] Wait 1 minute → Complete again → Get bolts
- [x] Complete category → Get bonus
- [x] Uncomplete/recomplete category → No bonus (24h cooldown)

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

### **Potential Additions**

1. **Daily Bolt Cap**
   - Maximum bolts per day (e.g., 1,000)

2. **Suspicious Activity Detection**
   - Track completion patterns
   - Flag unusual behavior (100 tasks in 1 minute)
   - Optional warning message

3. **Server-Side Validation** (if multiplayer added)
   - Validate all rewards on backend
   - Cryptographic signatures
   - Prevent client-side manipulation

4. **Achievement Integrity**
   - Verify achievement requirements
   - Prevent unlocking without meeting criteria
   - Cross-reference with task history

5. **Audit Log**
   - Track all bolt transactions
   - Review history for anomalies

## 💡 Best Practices

### **For Users**
- Play normally - anti-cheat won't affect you
- Cooldowns are generous for legitimate use
- Focus on building good habits, not farming bolts

### **For Developers**
- Balance protection with user experience
- Don't punish legitimate users
- Make cheating more effort than it's worth
- Trust users in single-player contexts

---

## 📈 Metrics to Monitor

If analytics are added, track:
- Average bolts earned per day
- Completion patterns (time between tasks)
- Category bonus frequency
- Outliers (users earning 10x average)

**Red Flags**:
- 100+ task completions in 1 minute
- 1000+ bolts earned in 1 hour
- Category bonus claimed every hour

---

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

1. **Prevention > Detection**: Stop exploits before they happen
2. **User Experience First**: Don't break flow for edge cases
3. **Trust Users**: In single-player, cheating is a choice
4. **Simple Solutions**: Timestamps and cooldowns work well
5. **Future-Proof**: Design allows for server-side validation later

**Status**: ✅ Anti-cheat system active and protecting bolt economy  
**Philosophy**: Gentle protection for honest users, not Fort Knox  
**Next Steps**: Monitor usage patterns, adjust if needed
