# Changelog - October 31, 2025

## Self-Care System Improvements

### ðŸ”© Fixed: Bolt Icon Display
**Issue:** Self-care bolt notifications were showing thunder bolt emoji (âš¡) instead of the custom screw/tool bolt image.

**Fix:** Updated `showBoltNotification()` function in `js/chore-system.js`
- Changed from emoji to actual `Bolt.png` image
- Path: `Imag/Achivments/Images/Finished Images/Bolt.png`
- Maintains thematic consistency (robots use mechanical bolts)
- Image size: 24x24px with proper alignment

**Code Change:**
```javascript
// Before:
notification.innerHTML = `<span>+${amount}</span><span>âš¡</span>`;

// After:
notification.innerHTML = `
    <span>+${amount}</span>
    <img src="Imag/Achivments/Images/Finished Images/Bolt.png" alt="Bolt" 
         style="width: 24px; height: 24px; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 4px;">
`;
```

### ðŸ¤– Added: Robot Dialogue for Self-Care Tasks
**Issue:** Robot companion was too quiet in the self-care section - no feedback when completing tasks.

**Enhancement:** Added 25% chance for robot to speak when completing self-care tasks
- 10 different encouraging phrases
- Randomly selected on each completion
- Only triggers when task is completed (not uncompleted)
- Uses existing `mascotSpeak()` function

**Dialogue Examples:**
- "Great job taking care of yourself! [task name] âœ“"
- "Self-care is important! Nice work on [task name]!"
- "You're doing great! [task name] complete! ðŸ’š"
- "Love to see it! [task name] done!"
- "Taking care of yourself? That's what I like to see!"
- "Your wellness matters! Good job with [task name]!"
- "Proud of you for [task name]! Keep it up!"
- "Self-care champion! [task name] âœ“"
- "You're worth it! [task name] complete!"
- "Looking after yourself? That's the spirit!"

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// 25% chance for robot to say something encouraging
if (Math.random() < 0.25 && this.mascotSpeak) {
    const encouragements = [ /* 10 phrases */ ];
    this.mascotSpeak(encouragements[Math.floor(Math.random() * encouragements.length)]);
}
```
