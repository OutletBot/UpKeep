# 🔄 Turn System - Move Multiple Robots!

## ✅ What Changed

### **Before:**
```
❌ Move one robot → Turn ends automatically
❌ Can't move other robots on board
❌ Forced to deploy new robots each turn
❌ No control over when turn ends
```

### **After:**
```
✅ Move any robot on the board
✅ Move multiple robots per turn
✅ No forced deployment
✅ Manual "End Turn" button
✅ Full control over your turn
```

## 🎮 How It Works Now

### **Turn Flow:**

```
1. Your Turn Starts
   └─> "End Turn" button appears (bottom-right)
   └─> All your robots are clickable
   └─> You can move ANY robot on the board

2. Move Robots (as many as you want!)
   ├─> Click any robot → Shows valid moves
   ├─> Click destination → Robot moves
   ├─> Click another robot → Move it too!
   └─> Repeat for all robots you want to move

3. End Your Turn
   └─> Click "End Turn" button when done
   └─> AI takes its turn
   └─> Your turn starts again
```

## 🤖 Moving Existing Robots

### **No More Forced Deployment!**

**You can now:**
- Move robots that are already on the board
- Reposition your forces strategically
- Don't need to deploy new robots every turn
- Only deploy when you want to

### **Example Turn:**

```
Turn 1:
  ├─> Deploy Bulbasaur to entry point
  ├─> Move Bulbasaur forward 3 spaces
  └─> Click "End Turn"

Turn 2:
  ├─> Move Bulbasaur again (he's still on board!)
  ├─> Deploy Charmander to entry point
  ├─> Move Charmander forward 2 spaces
  └─> Click "End Turn"

Turn 3:
  ├─> Move Bulbasaur to attack position
  ├─> Move Charmander to support
  ├─> Deploy Squirtle
  └─> Click "End Turn"
```

**Each turn, you can move ALL your robots on the board!**

---

## 🎯 Strategic Implications

### **Multiple Robot Movement:**

```
Before:
  Move Robot A → Turn ends
  (Robot B can't move this turn)

After:
  Move Robot A → Still your turn
  Move Robot B → Still your turn
  Move Robot C → Still your turn
  Click "End Turn" → Turn ends
```

### **Coordinated Attacks:**

```
Turn Example:
  1. Move Scout forward to scout enemy
  2. Move Vanguard to front line
  3. Move Support behind Vanguard
  4. Move Attacker to flank
  5. Click "End Turn"

All 4 robots moved in ONE turn!
```

## 💡 Movement Rules (Unchanged)

### **Each Robot Can Move:**
- Up to their **MP value** per turn
- From their **current position**
- Along **connected routes**
- To **empty points** only

### **Example:**
```
Scout (MP: 3)
  ├─> Currently at point A
  ├─> Can move up to 3 steps
  ├─> Cannot move through occupied points
  └─> Can reach any empty point within 3 steps

After moving:
  ├─> Scout is now at new position
  ├─> You can still move OTHER robots
  └─> Scout has used its movement for this turn
```

---

## 🎯 Turn Strategy Tips

### **1. Scout First:**
```
Move fast robots (high MP) first to scout
  └─> See enemy positions
  └─> Plan other movements accordingly
```

### **2. Coordinate Attacks:**
```
Move multiple robots adjacent to same enemy
  └─> Surround enemy
  └─> Multiple battle options
  └─> Strategic advantage
```

### **3. Defensive Positioning:**
```
Move robots to protect your goal
  └─> Block entry routes
  └─> Create defensive line
  └─> Support each other
```

### **4. Flexible Deployment:**
```
Don't deploy all robots at once
  └─> Keep some in reserve
  └─> Deploy based on situation
  └─> React to enemy moves
```
