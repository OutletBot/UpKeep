## 🎡 Latest Battle Wheel Enhancements (Oct 12, 2025 Evening)

### Feature: Pip Identifier System for Duplicate Moves
**Problem:** When a robot has two moves with the same color on its wheel, it was impossible to distinguish which move was selected during battle.

**Solution Implemented:**
1. **Pip identifier system** - Small dots overlay on wheel segments (lines 3817-3836, 17913-17979)
   - Segments with duplicate colors get 1, 2, or 3 pips (•, ••, •••)
   - Pips positioned in curved arc formation along segment
   - Individual pip positioning using polar-to-Cartesian conversion
2. **Visual display** - Pips shown in three places:
   - On wheel segments during spin
   - In result box after spin (e.g., "Purple (••)")
   - In wheel legend for reference
3. **Accurate positioning** - Pips curve with wheel segments
   - Each pip individually positioned at calculated angle
   - Arc spread: up to 8° or 40% of segment width
   - Rotate WITH wheel using proper DOM hierarchy

**Implementation Details:**
- `assignPipIdentifiers()` - Analyzes wheel, assigns pip counts to duplicates (lines 17876-17910)
- `addPipOverlay()` - Creates curved pip overlay on segments (lines 17950-17979)
- Pip CSS styling with glowing effects (lines 3817-3836)
- Result display includes pip counts (lines 17805-17830)

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - Duplicate moves now clearly identifiable

---

### Feature: Professional First Turn Wheel
**Problem:** Initial "who goes first" spinner was ugly - simple half-and-half disk with rough landing accuracy.

**Solution Implemented:**
1. **2-segment professional wheel** (lines 13951-13955)
   - PLAYER segment (48 positions, blue #00c8ff)
   - OPPONENT segment (48 positions, red #ff3232)
   - Clear labels on each segment
2. **Accurate center landing** (lines 13964-13972)
   - Behind-the-scenes 50-50 random
   - Lands in CENTER 9 positions of winner's segment
   - PLAYER: positions 20-28 (center of 1-48)
   - OPPONENT: positions 68-76 (center of 49-96)
   - Never lands on border lines
3. **Modern visual design** (lines 4651-4740)
   - "WHO GOES FIRST?" title
   - Gold glowing pointer (▼)
   - Rotating segment labels
   - 5 full rotations (1800°) + precise landing
   - 3.5s smooth cubic-bezier animation

**Implementation Details:**
- `buildFirstTurnWheel()` - Creates 2-segment conic-gradient wheel (lines 14006-14039)
- `calculateFirstTurnRotation()` - Calculates exact landing angle (lines 14041-14057)
- Segment labels rotate WITH wheel (lines 14016-14033)
- Label CSS with strong shadows for visibility (lines 4727-4740)

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - Professional wheel with accurate, clear results

## 🎨 UI Overhaul (Oct 12, 2025 Morning)

### Fix: Robot Clipping & Unified Layout
**Problem:** Robot figures were being cut off at top and bottom of screen. White circles appeared below game area. Layout felt cramped on Android.

**Root Cause:** Fixed heights (`min-height: 85px; max-height: 85px`) on `.player-zone` and `overflow: hidden` properties were clipping robot figures.

**Solution Applied:**
1. **Removed fixed heights** from all player zones - let content determine size
2. **Changed overflow to visible** on `.player-zone`, `.game-field`, `.bench-slot`, `.battle-content`
3. **Added z-index stacking** - player-zone: 10, game-field: 1 (benches render above board)
4. **Optimized all spacing for Android:**
   - Battle content padding: 10px → 5px

**Result:** ✅ **ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM BOARD SIZE ACHIEVED**. Opponent bench at absolute top. Board fills ALL vertical space. Zero wasted gaps. Truly maximized tactical viewport.

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - Final adjustment complete, peak viewport achieved

### UI/UX Improvement: Battle Log Integration
**Objective:** Move disruptive pop-up messages and turn status panel to battle log for cleaner visual experience.

**Implementation:**
1. **Replaced pop-up overlay with battle log entries** (line 16490)
   - Changed showTurnActionMessage() to use addToHistory()
   - All messages now appear in battle log instead of screen center
   - No more disruptive overlays blocking gameplay
2. **Hidden Turn Status panel** (line 15544)
   - Set display: none on turn-status-indicator
   - Panel no longer visible on screen
3. **Added Turn Status to battle log** (lines 15548-15557)
   - Status logged as system message when changed
   - Format: "Turn Status - Moved: ✅/❌, Battled: ✅/❌"
   - Added lastTurnStatusLog tracking (line 14294)
   - Prevents spam by only logging on status change
4. **Preserved existing UI elements:**
   - Player/Opponent turn indicator box unchanged
   - Battle Log position unchanged
   - Battle Log collapsible functionality intact

**Messages now in Battle Log:**
- Turn switches ("Turn switched to PLAYER!")
- Move warnings ("You can only move ONE robot per turn!")
- Battle notifications ("Robot deployed! You can battle X enemies...")
- Status updates ("Turn Status - Moved: ✅, Battled: ❌")

**Result:** ✅ **CLEANER VISUAL EXPERIENCE**. No disruptive pop-ups. All info in battle log. Professional, unobtrusive UI.

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - Battle log integration complete

### Selection & Highlighting System Fix
**Objective:** Perfect unit selection logic - fix bench deployment highlighting and eliminate sticky highlights.

**Bugs Fixed:**
1. **Bench deployment highlighting not working**
   - Valid move destinations weren't showing when selecting bench robots
   - Smart deployment calculation worked but highlights not displaying properly
2. **Sticky highlights bug**
   - Old highlights remained when switching from field robot to bench robot
   - Visual clutter and confusion

**Implementation:**
1. **Implemented "Clear First" principle** (lines 16012-16014)
   - Added clearSelection() and clearAttackableEnemies() at START of selectRobotForDeployment
   - Always clear ALL old highlights before showing new ones
   - Consistent with selectRobotForMovement() behavior
2. **Removed redundant clearing** (line 16072)
   - highlightSmartDeploymentDestinations no longer clears internally
   - Clearing happens once in selectRobotForDeployment
   - Single responsibility, cleaner code

**Clear First Principle:**
- Before any new highlights: clear everything
- Works for all scenarios: field-to-bench, bench-to-field, field-to-field, bench-to-bench
- Eliminates visual confusion and overlapping highlights
- Creates predictable, consistent behavior

**Result:** ✅ **SELECTION SYSTEM PERFECTED**. Bench robots now show ALL reachable destinations (entry points + spaces within remaining MP). Switching selections always clears first. Flawless, intuitive visual feedback.

**Additional Fix - Movable Space Images:**
- Root cause: Logic correct but images not visible (missing `active` class)
- Console logs showed 15 destinations calculated and `valid-move` class applied
- But `.movable-space-image` needs `active` class to be visible (opacity: 0 → 1)
- Added image activation for standard points (lines 16137-16144)
- Now matches field robot movement behavior perfectly

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - Selection highlighting fixed with "Clear First" + visible highlights

### Tactical Feedback & Safeguard System
**Objective:** Show battle opportunities clearly and prevent accidental premature turn endings.

**Part 1: Battle-Ready Highlighting - THREE-TRIGGER SYSTEM**
- **TRIGGER 1 (CRITICAL FIX):** Turn start global scan - highlights ALL adjacent enemies immediately (lines 14814-14869, 14378, 14399)
  - Added 100ms delay for DOM readiness (lines 14379-14381, 14403-14405)
- **TRIGGER 2:** When robot selected - highlights that robot's adjacent enemies (line 16788-16789)
- **TRIGGER 3:** After robot moves - highlights enemies at new position (line 17062-17063)
- **Visual effect:** Pulsing RED GLOW on adjacent enemy robots
- **CSS animation:** attackableEnemyPulse - smooth pulsing red effect (lines 4055-4068)
- **Battle log:** Message shows count of adjacent enemies
- **Interaction:** Click glowing red enemy to initiate battle
- **Result:** Battle opportunities ALWAYS visible from turn start - chess-like tactical clarity

**Part 2: "One Action Per Turn" Lock-In System**
- **Core Rule:** Move Robot B → Robot A becomes locked out (unselectable, cannot battle)
- **Component 1:** Selection Lock - blocks selecting other robots after move (line 16754)
- **Component 2:** Battle Lock - only moved robot can initiate battles (lines 17149-17155)
- **Component 3:** Tracking - `turnActions.lastMovedRobotPoint` records which robot moved
- **Component 4:** Focused Adjacency - clears ALL highlights, shows only moved robot's enemies
- **Component 5:** Refined End Turn - Check B only considers moved robot's battles (lines 15027-15042)
- **Result:** Strict "one action" enforcement - no confusing prompts about other robots

**Part 3: End Turn Confirmation (Two-Tier Check)**
- **Check A:** No move made → "You have not moved a robot this turn. Are you sure?" (lines 15017-15024)
- **Check B:** Moved robot has battle → "You can still attack X adjacent enemies! Are you sure?" (lines 15027-15042)
  - **Key:** Only checks `lastMovedRobotPoint` - ignores all other robots
- **User choice:** OK/Cancel buttons - can return to game or confirm end
- **Smart behavior:** No prompt if all actions taken (move + battle complete)

**Result:** ✅ **PROFESSIONAL TACTICAL EXPERIENCE**. Players see all opportunities with red glow. Strict "one action per turn" rule enforced. Only moved robot can battle. Clear visual feedback. Chess-like strategic polish.

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - Tactical feedback, lock-in system, and safeguards fully operational

## 🐛 Recent Critical Fixes (Oct 11, 2025)

### Fix 1: Robot Data Not Persisting
**Problem:** Robots were becoming "ghost" units - visually present but not clickable or interactive.

**Root Cause:** `getPointById()` was returning **shallow copies** instead of **references**, causing robot data modifications to be lost.

**Solution Applied:**
1. **Fixed `getPointById()`** to return direct references (line ~14062)
2. **Updated all robot data operations** to write directly to `gameBoard.pointType[pointId].robot`
3. **Fixed functions:**
   - `deployRobotToPoint()` (lines ~15814-15843)
   - `moveRobotToPoint()` (lines ~16246-16287)
   - `knockOutRobot()` (lines ~16752-16777)
   - `checkForSurrounds()` (line ~16406)

### Fix 2: First-Turn Handicap Persisting
**Problem:** `isFirstMoveOfGame` flag never cleared, causing -1 MP handicap to apply to ALL turns forever.

**Solution Applied:**
- Added flag clearing in `deployRobotToPoint()`, `executeSmartDeployment()`, and `moveRobotToPoint()`
- Added bench display refresh in `endPlayerTurn()` to update visual state
- Handicap now applies ONLY to the very first action of the game

### Fix 3: Debug Mode Auto-Skipping Opponent Turn
**Problem:** When opponent goes first in debug mode, AI turn auto-executed and immediately passed to player.

**Solution Applied:**
- Modified `onAITurnStart()` to intercept AI turns in debug mode
- Modified `onPlayerTurnStart()` to properly set control team
- Modified `endPlayerTurn()` to handle state transitions correctly
- Debug mode now allows manual control of both teams

### Fix 4: Auto-End Turn Not Working on First Turn
**Problem:** After deploying on first turn with no adjacent enemies, turn didn't auto-end (had to click "End Turn" manually).

**Solution Applied:**
- Added auto-end turn logic to `deployRobotToPoint()` (lines 16129-16142)
- Added auto-end turn logic to `executeSmartDeployment()` (lines 16232-16245)
- Now checks for adjacent enemies after deployment and auto-ends if none found
- Consistent with existing movement auto-end behavior

### Feature 5: WaitWin (System Lock Victory)
**Feature:** Implemented WaitWin victory condition from Pokémon Duel - instant win when opponent has no legal moves.

**Implementation:**
- Added `hasLegalMoves(team)` function (lines 14969-15019) - checks deployment and movement options
- Added `checkWaitWin(team)` function (lines 15021-15040) - detects opponent lockout
- Integrated into `onPlayerTurnStart()` (lines 14351-14352) and `onAITurnStart()` (lines 14366-14367, 14372-14373)
- Added `winType` state variable (line 14292) to track victory type
- Updated `showEndGameUI()` with WaitWin messages (lines 15048-15061)
- Checks at start of each turn, triggers instant victory if opponent locked

### Pattern Now Used Everywhere
```javascript
// Direct assignment to gameBoard
if (this.gameBoard.entryPoints[pointId]) {
    this.gameBoard.entryPoints[pointId].robot = data;
} else if (this.gameBoard.routePoints[pointId]) {
    this.gameBoard.routePoints[pointId].robot = data;
}
// ... etc for all point types
```

**Status:** ✅ FIXED - Robots now persist correctly, are clickable, and battles work

## 📋 Current System Status

### Robot Database
- `RobotDatabase.getRobot(id)` - Get robot stats (MP, name, etc.)
- Robot data includes: `id`, `name`, `mp` (movement points), `role`, `abilities`

## 🎯 Development Guidelines

### When Modifying Robot Data
1. **ALWAYS** write directly to `gameBoard.pointType[pointId].robot`
2. **NEVER** rely solely on `getPointById()` references for modifications
3. **TEST** persistence by calling `getPointById()` again after modification
4. **ADD** debug logging to verify data flow

### Testing Workflow
1. Start battle (Settings → Battle System)
2. Enable Debug Mode (checkbox in battle view)
3. Deploy robots to entry points (OE5A, OE6A for player / OE1A, OE2A for opponent)
4. Move robots using click-to-select, click-to-move
5. Verify robots are clickable after movement
6. Test battles by clicking adjacent enemies
7. Check console logs for data persistence

2. **Check** console logs for any errors during testing
3. **Test** the basic flow: Deploy → Move → Battle
4. **Remember** the direct assignment pattern for robot data
5. **Ask** the user what specific feature or bug they want to address

## 💬 Common User Testing Pattern

User typically tests by:
1. Starting battle and going first
2. Deploying Bulbasaur to entry point (OE5A or OE6A)
3. Ending turn (opponent deploys to OE1A or OE2A)
4. Moving toward center (O3A, O4A area)
5. Attempting to battle adjacent enemies
6. Reporting console logs if something fails

## 🔍 Debugging Tips

- Check `🤖 Points with robots:` log - should list all robots on board
- Look for `📊 Before/After` logs showing robot data state
- Verify `✅ Verification` logs confirm data persistence
- Watch for `null` robot data - indicates persistence failure
- Check `distance=X px` logs for click detection range
