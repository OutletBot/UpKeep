# 🎯 SURROUNDING MECHANIC - Instant KO!

## ✅ IMPLEMENTED!

The **Surrounding** mechanic is now fully functional! This powerful tactical feature allows you to instantly knock out enemy robots without risking a battle.

---

## 🎮 How It Works

### **Definition:**
A robot is **SURROUNDED** when ALL of its adjacent, connected points are occupied by enemy robots.

### **Result:**
- ⚡ **Instant Knockout** - No battle required!
- 💀 Surrounded robot is removed from the board immediately
- 🎯 Bypasses combat entirely (no spin, no risk!)

---

## 📋 Surrounding Rules

### **When It Triggers:**
```
After ANY robot movement:
  └─> System checks all enemy robots
  └─> If any enemy has ALL adjacent points occupied by your robots
  └─> That enemy is INSTANTLY knocked out!
```

### **Requirements:**
1. **All adjacent points** must be occupied
2. **Only enemy robots** count (empty spaces = NOT surrounded)
3. **Friendly robots** don't help surround (only enemies)

### **Example:**
```
Your Robots: 🟢
Enemy Robot: 🔴
Empty Point: ⚪

    🟢
    |
🟢--🔴--🟢
    |
    🟢

Red robot is SURROUNDED! ⚡
All 4 adjacent points occupied by green robots.
Red robot is instantly knocked out!
```

## 🎯 Strategic Applications

### **1. Remove Defensive Goalies**
```
Problem: Enemy has strong defender on their goal
Solution: Surround them instead of battling!

Benefits:
  ✅ No risk of losing the battle
  ✅ No luck involved (deterministic)
  ✅ Guaranteed removal
```

### **2. Eliminate High-Threat Units**
```
Problem: Enemy has powerful attacker you don't want to fight
Solution: Coordinate multiple robots to surround

Strategy:
  1. Position 3-4 robots around target
  2. Move final robot into last adjacent point
  3. Target is instantly removed!
```

### **3. Control Key Positions**
```
Tactic: Use surrounding threat to control territory

Example:
  - Enemy won't move to point if it can be surrounded
  - Forces enemy to avoid certain positions
  - Creates "no-go zones" on the board
```

### **4. Multi-Surround Combos**
```
Advanced: Surround multiple enemies in one move!

Setup:
  - Position robots to threaten 2+ enemies
  - One movement completes multiple surrounds
  - Multiple instant KOs in one turn!
```

## 🎨 Visual Feedback

### **When Surrounding Occurs:**

**1. Red Flash** 🔴
- Surrounded robot flashes bright red
- Thick red border (12px stroke)
- Intense red glow effect

**2. "⚠️ SURROUNDED!" Message**
- Red banner appears above robot
- Bold white text
- Visible for 0.8 seconds

**3. Removal Animation**
- Robot disappears after flash
- Sent to Repair Bay (when implemented)
- Console message confirms KO

## 💡 Tactical Tips

### **Offensive Surrounding:**

**Tip 1: Use High-MP Runners**
```
3 MP robots (Scouts) are perfect for surrounding:
  - Fast movement to get into position
  - Can reach multiple points quickly
  - Ideal for flanking maneuvers
```

**Tip 2: Coordinate Multiple Robots**
```
Don't try to surround with one robot:
  - Need 3-4 robots minimum
  - Position them over multiple turns
  - Final robot completes the surround
```

**Tip 3: Target Immobile Units**
```
Best targets for surrounding:
  - 1 MP Defenders (slow, can't escape)
  - Robots on Goal Point (can't move away)
  - Units with limited connections
```

### **Defensive Anti-Surrounding:**

**Tip 1: Keep Escape Routes**
```
Always maintain at least ONE empty adjacent point:
  - Don't let enemies box you in
  - Keep one connection to friendly territory
  - Retreat if surrounded threat appears
```

**Tip 2: Protect Your Goalie**
```
Goal Point is vulnerable to surrounding:
  - Place support robots nearby
  - Block enemy approach routes
  - Don't leave goalie isolated
```

**Tip 3: Recognize Surround Setups**
```
Watch for enemy positioning:
  - Multiple enemies near your robot = danger!
  - Count adjacent points vs enemy robots
  - Move away if 2+ adjacent points occupied
```

## 🔍 Technical Details

### **Surrounding Check Logic:**

```javascript
isSurrounded(pointId, robotTeam) {
    // Get all connected points
    const connections = point.connections;
    
    // Check each adjacent point
    for (each connectedPoint) {
        // If empty OR friendly = NOT surrounded
        if (!connectedPoint.robot || connectedPoint.robot.team === robotTeam) {
            return false;
        }
        
        // If enemy robot, continue checking
    }
    
    // All adjacent points have enemies = SURROUNDED!
    return true;
}
```

### **When It's Checked:**
- ✅ After every robot movement
- ✅ Checks ALL enemy robots on board
- ✅ Multiple surrounds can trigger at once

### **Console Output:**
```javascript
// When surround detected:
🎯 SURROUNDED! Knocking out 1 enemy robot(s): ['point-center-3']
💀 Charmander was SURROUNDED and knocked out instantly!

// If multiple surrounds:
🎯 SURROUNDED! Knocking out 2 enemy robot(s): ['point-left-2', 'point-right-4']
💀 Bulbasaur was SURROUNDED and knocked out instantly!
💀 Squirtle was SURROUNDED and knocked out instantly!
```

## 🎯 Example Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: Simple Surround**

```
Setup:
  - Enemy Snorlax on center point (1 MP, can't escape)
  - You have 3 robots adjacent
  - One empty adjacent point remains

Your Move:
  1. Move 4th robot into last adjacent point
  2. Snorlax is now surrounded
  3. ⚡ INSTANT KO! Snorlax removed!

Result:
  ✅ Removed powerful defender without battle
  ✅ No risk of losing your robot
  ✅ Path to goal now open
```

### **Scenario 2: Goal Point Surround**

```
Setup:
  - Enemy goalie on their Goal Point
  - Goal Point has 3 connections
  - You control 2 adjacent points

Your Move:
  1. Move robot to 3rd adjacent point
  2. Goalie is surrounded
  3. ⚡ INSTANT KO! Goalie removed!
  4. Goal Point now EMPTY!

Next Turn:
  5. Move any robot onto empty Goal Point
  6. 🏆 YOU WIN!
```

### **Scenario 3: Multi-Surround Combo**

```
Setup:
  - Two enemy robots next to each other
  - Both have 3 connections
  - You have robots positioned around both

Your Move:
  1. Move one robot to complete BOTH surrounds
  2. First enemy surrounded → ⚡ KO!
  3. Second enemy surrounded → ⚡ KO!
  4. TWO instant knockouts in one move!

Result:
  ✅ Massive tempo advantage
  ✅ Enemy loses 2 robots instantly
  ✅ Board control secured
```

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

### **Mistake 1: Incomplete Surround**
```
❌ WRONG:
  - 3 adjacent points occupied
  - 1 adjacent point EMPTY
  - Robot NOT surrounded (can still move)

✅ RIGHT:
  - ALL adjacent points occupied
  - No escape routes
  - Robot IS surrounded
```

### **Mistake 2: Friendly Robots Don't Help**
```
❌ WRONG:
  - Thinking your own robots help surround enemies
  - They don't! Only ENEMY robots count

✅ RIGHT:
  - Only YOUR robots can surround ENEMY robots
  - Friendly robots don't contribute to surrounds
```

### **Mistake 3: Forgetting Point Connections**
```
❌ WRONG:
  - Assuming all points have 4 connections
  - Some points have 2-3 connections only

✅ RIGHT:
  - Check actual connections for each point
  - Corner points easier to surround (fewer connections)
  - Center points harder (more connections)
```
