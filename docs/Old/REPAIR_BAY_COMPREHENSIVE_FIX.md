# Repair Bay System - Comprehensive Fix & Verification

## 🐛 **Final Bug Fixed**
Greyed-out "Rebooting" visual sometimes didn't disappear after the robot was ready to deploy.

**User Report**:
> "it worked! but its still glitchy, sometimes the 'rebooting' greyed out image doesn't disappear, leaving the player thinking they cant move the robot."

---

## 🔍 **Root Cause**

The `processRebootingStatus()` function was removing the rebooting status from the data structure but **NOT updating the bench display** to refresh the visuals.

### **The Flow (Broken)**:
```
Turn X: Robot returns with Rebooting: 2
  → updateBenchDisplay() called ✅
  → Robot shows greyed-out with badge ✅

Turn X+1: Player turn starts
  → processRebootingStatus('player') runs
  → Countdown: 2 → 1
  → No display update ❌
  → Robot STILL shows greyed-out ❌

Turn X+3: Player turn starts again
  → processRebootingStatus('player') runs
  → Countdown: 1 → 0, status removed
  → No display update ❌
  → Robot STILL shows greyed-out ❌❌❌
  → Player thinks robot is broken!
```

---

## ✅ **The Fix**

Added `updateBenchDisplay()` call after processing rebooting status changes:

**File**: `index.html`, Lines 17844-17848

```javascript
// Remove completed reboots
toRemove.forEach(robotId => {
    delete this.rebootingRobots[robotId];
});

// Update bench display to refresh visual state (remove greyed-out styling)
if (toRemove.length > 0 || Object.keys(this.rebootingRobots).length > 0) {
    this.updateBenchDisplay(team);
    console.log(`🎨 Bench display refreshed after rebooting status update`);
}
```

---

## 🎯 **Complete System Flow**

### **1. Robot Defeated → Repair Bay**
```javascript
// Battle System (Line 17661)
sendToRepairBay(robotId, team)
  → Add to repairBay array
  → If bay.length > 2: overflow!
    → Call returnToBench(oldestRobotId, team, true)
  → updateRepairBayDisplay(team) ✅
```

### **2. Robot Returns to Bench**
```javascript
// Repair Bay System (Line 17715)
returnToBench(robotId, team, addRebootingStatus=true)
  → Find empty bench slot
  → benchSlots[slotId].robotId = robotId
  → rebootingRobots[robotId] = 2 ✅
  → updateBenchDisplay(team) ✅ (Shows greyed-out)
```

### **3. Turn Starts → Process Countdown**
```javascript
// Turn Management (Line 14422 / 14455)
onPlayerTurnStart() / onAITurnStart()
  → processRebootingStatus(team)
    → For each rebooting robot:
      → Decrement count: 2 → 1, or 1 → 0
      → If count <= 0: remove status
    → updateBenchDisplay(team) ✅✅✅ (NEW FIX)
```

### **4. Player Tries to Deploy**
```javascript
// Deployment System (Line 16267)
selectRobotForDeployment(robotId, teamType, benchIndex)
  → isRobotRebooting(robotId)?
    → YES: Block deployment, show message ✅
    → NO: Allow deployment
```

### **5. Robot Deployed Successfully**
```javascript
// Deployment System (Line 16573 / 16731)
deployRobotToPoint() / executeSmartDeployment()
  → Clear benchSlots[slotId].robotId = null
  → updateBenchDisplay() ✅ (Removes from bench)
```

## 📊 **All updateBenchDisplay() Calls**

| Location | Line | Trigger | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|---------|
| `deployTeamToBench()` | 16103 | Game start | Initial bench population |
| `endTurn()` | 15128 | Turn end | Refresh first-turn handicap visuals |
| `deployRobotToPoint()` | 16573 | Robot deployed | Remove deployed robot from bench |
| `executeSmartDeployment()` | 16731 | Smart deploy | Remove deployed robot from bench |
| `returnToBench()` | 17748 | Robot returns | Show rebooting robot on bench |
| `processRebootingStatus()` | 17846 | Turn start | **Refresh rebooting visuals** ✅ |

## 🧪 **Comprehensive Test Plan**

### **Test 1: Visual Updates During Rebooting**
```
1. Have 3 robots defeated (3rd pushes oldest to bench)
2. ✅ Robot appears on bench with:
   - Greyed out (opacity 0.4)
   - Grayscale filter (80%)
   - Orange "⏳ Rebooting" badge
   - Cursor: not-allowed
3. End turn (switch to opponent)
4. ✅ Robot STILL greyed out (countdown not their turn)
5. End turn (back to you)
6. ✅ Robot STILL greyed out (countdown: 2 → 1)
7. End turn twice more (full cycle)
8. ✅ Robot NO LONGER greyed out
9. ✅ Badge removed
10. ✅ Normal cursor
11. ✅ Can deploy successfully
```

### **Test 2: Multiple Robots Rebooting**
```
1. Have 5 robots defeated quickly
2. ✅ First 2 in Repair Bay
3. ✅ 3rd pushes #1 to bench (Rebooting: 2)
4. ✅ 4th pushes #2 to bench (Rebooting: 2)
5. ✅ 5th pushes #3 to bench (Rebooting: 2)
6. End turn cycle
7. ✅ All 3 robots countdown together
8. ✅ All 3 robots clear rebooting at proper times
9. ✅ All 3 robots visually update correctly
```

### **Test 3: Rapid Turn Cycling**
```
1. Robot returns with Rebooting: 2
2. Rapidly end turns (player → opponent → player → opponent)
3. ✅ Countdown progresses correctly (2 → 1 → 1 → 0)
4. ✅ Visual updates each time
5. ✅ No stuck greyed-out robots
6. ✅ No duplicate badges
```

### **Test 4: Deployment Blocking**
```
1. Robot with Rebooting: 2 on bench
2. Click robot on Turn X+1
3. ✅ Blocked with message
4. ✅ No deployment highlights shown
5. Wait for Turn X+3
6. Click robot
7. ✅ Deployment highlights shown
8. ✅ Can deploy successfully
```

### **Test 5: Mixed First-Turn & Rebooting**
```
1. Start new game (isFirstMoveOfGame = true)
2. Have 1MP robot on bench (first-turn handicap)
3. ✅ Shows "1st Turn" badge (blue)
4. Have robot return from Repair Bay
5. ✅ Shows "⏳ Rebooting" badge (orange)
6. ✅ Both badges display correctly
7. End turn
8. ✅ First-turn handicap clears
9. ✅ Rebooting badge remains
10. Continue turn cycle
11. ✅ Rebooting badge clears eventually
```

### **Test 6: Edge Case - Bench Full**
```
1. Fill bench with 6 robots
2. Have robot return from Repair Bay
3. ✅ Error: "Bench full - robot could not return"
4. ✅ No crash
5. ✅ Robot disappears (lost)
```

### **Test 7: Console Verification**
```
Expected console logs:
✅ "⏳ unit-XXX has Rebooting: 2 status - cannot deploy for 1 full turn"
✅ "⏳ Processing Rebooting status for player..."
✅ "⏳ unit-XXX rebooting countdown: 2 → 1"
✅ "🎨 Bench display refreshed after rebooting status update"
✅ "⏳ unit-XXX rebooting countdown: 1 → 0"
✅ "✅ unit-XXX rebooting complete - can now deploy"
✅ "🎨 Bench display refreshed after rebooting status update"
```
