# Deployment Rules - VERIFIED ‚úÖ

## üìú **The Three Core Deployment Rules**

### **Rule 1: The Gateway** üö™
**"You can only deploy a robot onto one of your two Entry Points‚Äîthe corner spaces on your back row."**

- ‚úÖ **Enforced at**: Lines 16410-16475 in `deployRobotToPoint()`
- ‚úÖ **Implementation**: Robot MUST pass through an entry point to deploy
- ‚úÖ **Smart Deployment**: Can click on points beyond entry points, robot auto-routes through entry
- ‚úÖ **Visual Feedback**: Entry points AND reachable points beyond them are highlighted

**Entry Points**:
- **Player Team**: `entry-bottom-left`, `entry-bottom-right` (bottom corners)
- **Opponent Team**: `entry-top-left`, `entry-top-right` (top corners)

**How It Works**:
1. Robot MUST enter the board through an entry point (corner space)
2. If robot has MP remaining after deployment cost, can move further
3. Click on final destination, robot auto-routes through entry point

---

### **Rule 2: The Cost** üí∞
**"Deploying a robot always costs exactly 1 Movement Point (MP)."**

- ‚úÖ **Enforced at**: Line 16318 in `highlightSmartDeploymentDestinations()`
- ‚úÖ **Implementation**: `const remainingMP = effectiveMP - 1;` (deployment cost is 1 MP)
- ‚úÖ **Console Log**: "Deployment cost: 1 MP (counts as mandatory move for this turn)"
- ‚úÖ **Note**: This 1 MP cost is your ENTIRE move for that turn (see Rule 3)

**Code Reference**:
```javascript
// Deployment costs exactly 1 MP (entire move)
console.log(`üí∞ Deployment cost: 1 MP (counts as your mandatory move)`);
```

---

### **Rule 3: The Mandatory Move** üîí
**"This action counts as your single, mandatory move for that turn."**

- ‚úÖ **Enforced at**: Lines 16503-16507 in `deployRobotToPoint()`
- ‚úÖ **Implementation**: 
  - `this.turnActions.hasMovedRobot = true;` - Marks that movement action is used
  - `this.turnActions.actionTakenThisTurn = true;` - Marks that an action was taken
  - `this.turnActions.lastMovedRobotPoint = pointId;` - Locks in which robot can battle
- ‚úÖ **Effect**: After deploying, you CANNOT move another robot this turn
- ‚úÖ **Next Step**: You can only battle with the deployed robot OR end your turn

**Code Reference**:
```javascript
// Mark that robot has been deployed this turn - LOCK-IN to this robot only
this.turnActions.hasMovedRobot = true;
this.turnActions.actionTakenThisTurn = true;
this.turnActions.lastMovedRobotPoint = pointId;
console.log(`‚úÖ Turn action recorded: Robot deployed (movement action used)`);
console.log(`üîí LOCK-IN: Only robot at ${pointId} can battle this turn`);
```

## ‚úÖ **Smart Deployment Feature**

### **What It Does**:
The system has a "Smart Deployment" feature that allows deploying directly to points BEYOND entry points by automatically routing through an entry point. This follows **Rule 1: The Gateway** (robot enters through entry point) while providing convenience.

### **How It Works**:
```
‚úÖ Select robot ‚Üí Click point 3 spaces away ‚Üí Robot deploys to entry, then auto-moves to destination
‚úÖ Select robot ‚Üí Click entry point directly ‚Üí Robot deploys to entry point and stops
```

### **Implementation**:
1. **`highlightSmartDeploymentDestinations()` (lines 16306-16354)**:
   - ‚úÖ Calculates entry points AND reachable points beyond entry points
   - ‚úÖ Highlights all valid destinations (entry points + reachable from entries)

2. **`deployRobotToPoint()` (lines 16393-16476)**:
   - ‚úÖ If clicking entry point: Deploy directly
   - ‚úÖ If clicking beyond entry: Route through available entry point automatically

3. **`executeSmartDeployment()` (lines 16558+)**:
   - ‚úÖ Handles automatic routing: Deploy to entry ‚Üí Move to final destination

## üéÆ **How Deployment Works Now**

### **Step-by-Step Process**:

1. **Select Robot from Bench**
   - Click on a robot in your bench
   - System checks: Is robot rebooting? Already moved this turn?

2. **Valid Destinations Highlighted**
   - Your two entry points (corner spaces) are highlighted
   - Points reachable from entry points (within remaining MP) are also highlighted
   - Occupied points are NOT highlighted

3. **Click Destination**
   - Click on ANY highlighted destination
   - Can be entry point OR a point beyond entry point
   - System verifies: Is this reachable? Which entry to use?

4. **Robot Deploys (Smart Routing)**
   - If clicked entry point: Robot appears at entry point
   - If clicked beyond entry: Robot deploys to entry, then auto-moves to destination
   - Robot data added to game board
   - Robot removed from bench

5. **Turn Action Locked**
   - Movement action is used (cannot move another robot)
   - Only this robot can battle this turn
   - Must end turn to continue

## üß™ **Testing Deployment Rules**

### **Test 1: The Gateway Rule (Smart Deployment)**
```javascript
// 1. Select a robot with 3 MP from bench
// 2. Check which spaces are highlighted
// Expected: Entry points + 2 spaces beyond each entry (within 2 MP range)

// 3. Click on entry point directly
// Expected: Robot deploys to entry point

// 4. Select another robot with 3 MP
// 5. Click on a highlighted point 2 spaces beyond entry
// Expected: Robot auto-routes through entry, then moves to destination
```

### **Test 2: The Cost Rule**
```javascript
// 1. Select a robot with 2 MP
// 2. Deploy to entry point
// 3. Check console logs
// Expected: "Deployment cost: 1 MP (counts as mandatory move for this turn)"
```

### **Test 3: The Mandatory Move Rule**
```javascript
// 1. Deploy a robot to entry point
// 2. Try to select another robot from bench
// Expected: "Cannot deploy - already moved/deployed a robot this turn!"

// 3. Try to move a different robot on the board
// Expected: Blocked (only the deployed robot can battle or be selected)

// 4. End turn
// Expected: Turn ends successfully, opponent's turn starts
```

### **Test 4: Smart Deployment Range**
```javascript
// 1. Select robot with 4 MP from bench (3 MP remaining after deployment cost)
// 2. Count highlighted spaces
// Expected: Entry points + all points within 3 MP from each entry

// 3. Select robot with 1 MP from bench (0 MP remaining after deployment cost)
// Expected: ONLY entry points highlighted (no points beyond)

// 4. Verify occupied points are NOT highlighted
// Expected: Entry point with robot on it is NOT highlighted
```

## üìä **Rule Enforcement Summary**

| Rule | Enforced? | Code Location | Method |
|------|-----------|---------------|--------|
| **The Gateway** | ‚úÖ YES | Lines 16410-16475 | Robot routes through entry point |
| **The Cost** | ‚úÖ YES | Line 16318 | `remainingMP = effectiveMP - 1` |
| **Mandatory Move** | ‚úÖ YES | Lines 16503-16507 | `turnActions.hasMovedRobot = true` |

## üêõ **Known Issues & Edge Cases**

### **Issue 1: Occupied Entry Points**
**Scenario**: Both entry points are occupied by your own robots  
**Behavior**: Cannot deploy (no entry points highlighted)  
**Solution**: Move robots away from entry points before deploying

### **Issue 2: First Turn Handicap**
**Scenario**: Robot with 1 MP on first turn (handicap reduces to 0 MP)  
**Behavior**: Cannot deploy (needs at least 1 MP after handicap)  
**Error**: "Cannot deploy - insufficient MP after first-turn handicap"  
**Solution**: Wait for second turn OR use robots with 2+ MP

### **Issue 3: Rebooting Robots**
**Scenario**: Robot has "Rebooting: 1" status from Repair Bay overflow  
**Behavior**: Cannot deploy (blocked by rebooting status)  
**Error**: "Robot is rebooting - cannot deploy this turn"  
**Solution**: Wait 1 turn for rebooting status to clear

## üéØ **Summary**

All three deployment rules are **properly enforced** with **Smart Deployment** convenience:

1. ‚úÖ **The Gateway**: Robots enter through entry points (corners), can auto-route to points beyond
2. ‚úÖ **The Cost**: Deployment always costs exactly 1 MP
3. ‚úÖ **Mandatory Move**: Deployment counts as your single move for the turn

**Smart Deployment feature is ACTIVE**: Click any highlighted destination, robot auto-routes through entry point.
