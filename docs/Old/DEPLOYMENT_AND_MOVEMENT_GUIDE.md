# 🚀 Deployment + Movement System

## ✅ NEW: Deploy and Move in One Turn!

**Deployment no longer ends your turn!** After deploying a robot to an entry point, you can immediately move it up to its MP value.

---

## 🎮 How It Works

### **Complete Turn Flow:**

```
1. Click robot in bench
   └─> Robot gets gold border
   └─> Entry points highlight blue

2. Click entry point
   └─> Robot deploys to entry point
   └─> Robot AUTOMATICALLY selected (gold glow) ✨
   └─> Valid moves highlight green 🟢
   └─> Entry point counts as distance 0

3. Click green destination
   └─> Robot moves to destination
   └─> Turn complete!
```

---

## 📏 Movement Calculation

### **Entry Point = Distance 0**

The entry point where you deploy counts as your starting position (distance 0).  
From there, you can move up to your robot's MP value.

### **Example: Bulbasaur (3 MP)**

```
Step 1: Deploy to entry-bottom-left
  └─> Bulbasaur appears at entry point
  └─> Automatically selected (gold glow)
  └─> Shows valid moves

Step 2: Can move to:
  ✅ Points 1 step away (distance 1)
  ✅ Points 2 steps away (distance 2)
  ✅ Points 3 steps away (distance 3)

Step 3: Click destination
  └─> Bulbasaur moves there
  └─> Turn ends
```

## 🗺️ Visual Example

### **Bulbasaur Deployment (3 MP):**

```
Board Layout:
    [point-left-3] ← 3 steps away ✅
         |
    [point-left-2] ← 2 steps away ✅
         |
    [point-left-1] ← 1 step away ✅
         |
    [entry-bottom-left] ← Deploy here (distance 0)
         |
    [point-bottom-1] ← 1 step away ✅
         |
    [point-bottom-2] ← 2 steps away ✅
         |
    [point-bottom-3] ← 3 steps away ✅

After deploying to entry-bottom-left:
- Entry point = distance 0 (starting position)
- Can move 1, 2, or 3 steps in any direction
- Green highlights show all valid destinations
```

---

## 🎯 Different Robot Types

### **Sentinel (1 MP):**
```
Deploy to entry point
Can move: 1 step away only
Example: entry → point-bottom-1
```

### **Vanguard (2 MP):**
```
Deploy to entry point
Can move: 1 or 2 steps away
Example: entry → point-bottom-2
```

### **Scout (3 MP):**
```
Deploy to entry point
Can move: 1, 2, or 3 steps away
Example: entry → point-bottom-3
```

---

## 🔄 Automatic Selection

### **What Happens After Deployment:**

```javascript
1. Robot deploys to entry point
   └─> Visual appears on board
   └─> Removed from bench

2. System automatically:
   ├─> Selects the robot (gold glow)
   ├─> Calculates valid moves
   ├─> Highlights destinations (green)
   └─> Waits for your move

3. You can:
   ├─> Click green point to move
   └─> Or click another robot to switch selection
```

---

## 🎮 Complete Gameplay Example

### **Turn 1: Deploy Bulbasaur**

```
Action 1: Click Bulbasaur in bench
  └─> Bulbasaur gets gold border
  └─> Entry points highlight blue

Action 2: Click entry-bottom-left
  └─> Bulbasaur deploys to entry
  └─> Automatically selected (gold glow)
  └─> 12 points highlight green (3 MP range)

Action 3: Click point-bottom-3 (3 steps away)
  └─> Bulbasaur moves there
  └─> Turn complete!

Result: Bulbasaur is now 3 steps into the board!
```

---

## 🚫 Blocking Still Applies

### **If Path is Blocked:**

```
Your Bulbasaur (3 MP) deploys to entry-bottom-left
Enemy robot at point-bottom-1

After deployment:
✅ Can move left path (clear)
   - point-left-1 (1 step)
   - point-left-2 (2 steps)
   - point-left-3 (3 steps)

❌ Cannot move bottom path (blocked)
   - point-bottom-1 (occupied)
   - point-bottom-2 (blocked)
   - point-bottom-3 (blocked)

You must choose an alternate route!
```

---

## 💡 Strategic Implications

### **Aggressive Deployment:**
```
Deploy Scout (3 MP) to entry
Move 3 steps forward
Result: Deep into enemy territory in one turn!
```

### **Defensive Deployment:**
```
Deploy Sentinel (1 MP) to entry
Move 1 step forward
Result: Guard entry point area
```

### **Balanced Deployment:**
```
Deploy Vanguard (2 MP) to entry
Move 2 steps forward
Result: Moderate board presence
```

3. **Deployment doesn't end turn** - you can move!
4. **Auto-selection** makes it seamless
5. **Green highlights** show where you can go
