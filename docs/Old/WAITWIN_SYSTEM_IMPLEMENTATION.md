# WaitWin (System Lock Victory) Implementation

## üéØ Overview
Implemented the **WaitWin** victory condition from Pok√©mon Duel, also known as **System Lock Victory**. This occurs when a player's actions result in their opponent having no legal moves available, causing an instant victory.

---

## üìã What is WaitWin?

### Definition
A **WaitWin** (or **System Lock**) occurs when:
1. A player's turn begins
2. The opponent has **no legal moves** available
3. The current player wins immediately without taking any action

### Legal Moves Include
- **Deployment:** Placing a robot from bench to an available entry point
- **Movement:** Moving any robot on the field to an adjacent connected point

### When It Triggers
- Checked at the **start of each turn** (before any actions)
- If opponent is locked, current player wins instantly
- Game ends immediately with System Lock Victory message

---

## üîß Technical Implementation

### New Functions Added

#### 1. `hasLegalMoves(team)` (lines 14969-15019)
Checks if a team has any legal moves available.

**Logic:**
```javascript
hasLegalMoves(team) {
    // Check 1: Can deploy from bench?
    for (bench robots) {
        for (entry points) {
            if (entry point is empty) {
                return true; // Can deploy
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Check 2: Can move any robot on field?
    for (all points on board) {
        if (point has team's robot) {
            if (robot can move to any adjacent point) {
                return true; // Can move
            }
        }
    }
    
    return false; // No legal moves - SYSTEM LOCK!
}
```

**Checks:**
1. **Bench Deployment:**
   - Iterates through bench robots
   - Checks if any entry point is available
   - Returns `true` if deployment possible

2. **Field Movement:**
   - Iterates through all board points
   - Finds robots belonging to the team
   - Uses `calculateValidMovesWithinMP()` to check movement
   - Returns `true` if any robot can move

3. **No Moves:**
   - Returns `false` if no deployments or movements possible
   - Triggers System Lock condition

---

#### 2. `checkWaitWin(team)` (lines 15021-15040)
Checks if the current team has locked the opponent.

**Logic:**
```javascript
checkWaitWin(team) {
    const opponent = team === 'player' ? 'opponent' : 'player';
    
    if (!hasLegalMoves(opponent)) {
        // Opponent is locked!
        this.winType = 'waitwin';
        this.setState(team wins);
        return true;
    }
    
    return false;
}
```

**Behavior:**
- Determines opponent team
- Calls `hasLegalMoves(opponent)`
- If opponent locked:
  - Logs victory message
  - Adds to battle history
  - Sets `winType = 'waitwin'`
  - Transitions to win state
  - Returns `true` (game over)
- If opponent has moves:
  - Returns `false` (game continues)

---

### Integration Points

#### Turn Start Checks

**`onPlayerTurnStart()`** (lines 14351-14352):
```javascript
// Check for WaitWin (System Lock Victory)
if (this.checkWaitWin('player')) return;
```

**`onAITurnStart()`** (lines 14366-14367, 14372-14373):
```javascript
// In debug mode
if (this.checkWaitWin('opponent')) return;

// In normal AI mode
if (this.checkWaitWin('opponent')) return;
```

**Execution Order:**
1. Turn starts
2. Check goal capture (`checkWinConditions`)
3. Check WaitWin (`checkWaitWin`)
4. If both pass, proceed with turn

---

### State Management

#### New State Variable (line 14292):
```javascript
winType: null, // Track win type: 'goal', 'waitwin', 'timeout'
```

**Purpose:**
- Tracks how the game was won
- Used by `showEndGameUI()` to display appropriate message
- Set by win condition functions

**Values:**
- `'goal'` - Goal capture victory
- `'waitwin'` - System Lock victory
- `'timeout'` - Turn limit reached (draw)

---

### UI Updates

#### End Game Messages (lines 15046-15061)

**Player Victory:**
- **Goal Capture:** "You captured the opponent's goal!"
- **WaitWin:** "System Lock Victory! Opponent has no legal moves!"

**Player Defeat:**
- **Goal Capture:** "The opponent captured your goal!"
- **WaitWin:** "System Lock Defeat! You have no legal moves!"

**Draw:**
- **Timeout:** "Turn limit reached (300 turns)."

## üéÆ Gameplay Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Bench Blocked, Field Locked
```
Opponent State:
- Bench: 3 robots remaining
- Entry Points: Both occupied by player's robots
- Field Robots: All surrounded or blocked
- Result: SYSTEM LOCK - No deployments, no movements
```

### Scenario 2: Empty Bench, Immobile Robots
```
Opponent State:
- Bench: Empty (all deployed)
- Field Robots: All surrounded by player's robots
- Result: SYSTEM LOCK - No robots to deploy, can't move
```

### Scenario 3: Strategic Lockout
```
Player Action:
- Deploys robot to last available entry point
- Opponent's remaining bench robots can't deploy
- Opponent's field robots are all blocked
- Next Turn: WAITWIN triggered!
```

---

## üß™ Testing Scenarios

### Test 1: Entry Point Lockout
1. Deploy robots to both opponent entry points
2. Ensure opponent has robots on bench
3. Ensure opponent's field robots can't move
4. End turn
5. **Expected:** WaitWin triggered, player wins

### Test 2: Complete Surrounding
1. Surround all opponent robots
2. Ensure opponent bench is empty
3. End turn
4. **Expected:** WaitWin triggered, player wins

### Test 3: False Positive Prevention
1. Block opponent entry points
2. Ensure opponent has at least one movable robot
3. End turn
4. **Expected:** No WaitWin, game continues

   ‚úÖ player can deploy Charizard to PE5A
```

**System Lock Detection:**
```

## üéØ Strategic Implications

### Offensive Strategy
1. **Entry Point Control:** Occupy opponent's entry points
2. **Surrounding:** Trap opponent's robots
3. **Mobility Denial:** Block movement paths
4. **Bench Pressure:** Force opponent to deploy all robots

### Defensive Strategy
1. **Preserve Mobility:** Keep at least one robot mobile
2. **Entry Point Access:** Don't let both entries get blocked
3. **Bench Management:** Keep robots in reserve
4. **Escape Routes:** Maintain movement options
