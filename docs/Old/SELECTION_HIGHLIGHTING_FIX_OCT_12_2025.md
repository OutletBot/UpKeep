# Selection and Highlighting System Fix - October 12, 2025

## üéØ Objective
Perfect the unit selection logic to be flawless and intuitive. Fix two critical bugs:
1. **Bench deployment highlighting** - Show ALL reachable destinations when selecting bench robot
2. **Sticky highlights bug** - Clear old highlights when switching selections

---

## üêõ Bugs Identified

### Bug 1: Bench Deployment Highlighting Not Working
**Problem:**
- When selecting robot from bench, valid move destinations weren't being highlighted properly
- Smart deployment calculation existed but highlights weren't showing
- Only entry points visible, not the spaces reachable from those entry points

**User Impact:**
- Players couldn't see where bench robots could move
- Confusing and unintuitive deployment experience
- Had to guess which spaces were reachable

### Bug 2: Sticky Highlights When Switching Selections
**Problem:**
- When selecting field robot (shows highlights), then selecting bench robot, old highlights remained
- Previous selection's visual feedback wasn't cleared
- Caused overlapping, confusing highlight patterns

**User Impact:**
- Visual clutter and confusion
- Couldn't tell which highlights were current vs old
- Made it look like robots could move to invalid spaces

---

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### Why Bench Highlighting Wasn't Working

**Code Investigation:**
The `highlightSmartDeploymentDestinations()` function (lines 16068-16130) was correctly:
1. Calculating entry points
2. Calculating remaining MP after deployment cost
3. Using BFS to find all reachable destinations from entry points
4. Storing all valid destinations in a Set

**The actual highlighting code was working!** The destinations were being added to `allValidDestinations` and the highlighting loop (lines 16114-16127) was correctly applying the `valid-move` class.

**So why wasn't it showing?**

The issue was that the highlights WERE being applied, but they might have been:
1. Cleared too early by other code
2. Not triggered properly in all cases
3. Or the clearSelection() was interfering

### Why Sticky Highlights Occurred

**Code Investigation:**
- `selectRobotForMovement()` (line 16560) correctly called `clearSelection()` and `clearAttackableEnemies()` BEFORE showing new highlights (lines 16595-16596)
- But `selectRobotForDeployment()` (line 16009) did NOT call these clear functions
- It only had internal clearing in `highlightSmartDeploymentDestinations()` (lines 16068-16073) which only cleared specific classes on points
- This internal clearing didn't clear:
  - Robot selection visual effects (glowing, enlarged robots)
  - Attackable enemy highlights
  - Bench robot selection states

**Result:** When switching from field robot to bench robot:
1. Field robot's glow effect remained
2. Field robot's move highlights remained
3. New bench robot highlights overlapped with old ones
4. Visual chaos!

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### The "Clear First" Principle

**Inviolable Rule:** Before any new highlights are displayed, ALL old highlights must be cleared. No exceptions.

**Implementation:**
Added comprehensive clearing at the START of `selectRobotForDeployment()`:

```javascript
// CLEAR FIRST PRINCIPLE: Always clear previous selection before showing new highlights
console.log('üßπ CLEAR FIRST: Clearing all previous highlights and selections');
this.clearSelection();
this.clearAttackableEnemies();
```

---

### Change 1: Added Clear First to Bench Selection

**Modified:** `selectRobotForDeployment()` (lines 16011-16014)

**Before:**
```javascript
selectRobotForDeployment(robotId, teamType, benchIndex) {
    // Check if robot has already been moved this turn
    if (this.turnActions.hasMovedRobot) {
        // ...
    }
    // ... rest of function
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
selectRobotForDeployment(robotId, teamType, benchIndex) {
    // CLEAR FIRST PRINCIPLE: Always clear previous selection before showing new highlights
    console.log('üßπ CLEAR FIRST: Clearing all previous highlights and selections');
    this.clearSelection();
    this.clearAttackableEnemies();
    
    // Check if robot has already been moved this turn
    if (this.turnActions.hasMovedRobot) {
        // ...
    }
    // ... rest of function
}
```

**Impact:**
- All old highlights cleared BEFORE showing new bench robot highlights
- Consistent with `selectRobotForMovement()` behavior
- Fixes sticky highlights bug completely

---

### Change 2: Removed Redundant Clearing Code

**Modified:** `highlightSmartDeploymentDestinations()` (lines 16072-16073)

**Before:**
```javascript
highlightSmartDeploymentDestinations(robotId, teamType, effectiveMP) {
    console.log(`üéØ SMART DEPLOYMENT: Calculating destinations...`);
    
    // Clear previous highlights
    document.querySelectorAll('.point').forEach(el => {
        el.classList.remove('valid-deployment');
        el.classList.remove('valid-move');
    });
    document.querySelectorAll('.entry-space-image').forEach(img => 
        img.classList.remove('valid-deployment')
    );
    
    // Get entry points...
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
highlightSmartDeploymentDestinations(robotId, teamType, effectiveMP) {
    console.log(`üéØ SMART DEPLOYMENT: Calculating destinations...`);
    
    // NOTE: Clearing is already done in selectRobotForDeployment via clearSelection()
    // No need to clear again here - follows "Clear First" principle
    
    // Get entry points...
}
```

**Impact:**
- Cleaner code - no redundant clearing
- Single responsibility - clearing happens in one place
- Easier to maintain and debug

## üìä What clearSelection() Does

The `clearSelection()` function (lines 16514-16557) is comprehensive and clears:

1. **Selection State Variables**
   - `this.selectedRobotForDeployment = null`
   - `this.selectedRobotForMovement = null`

2. **Bench Robot Visual Feedback**
   - Removes 'selected' class from all `.bench-robot` elements

3. **Point Highlights**
   - Removes 'valid-deployment', 'selected', 'valid-move' classes from all `.point` elements
   - Clears cursor styles

4. **Space Image Highlights**
   - Clears `.movable-space-image` active states
   - Clears `.entry-space-image` valid-deployment states
   - Clears `.goal-space-image` valid-goal states

5. **Robot Visual Effects**
   - Resets robot circle size (back to radius 50)
   - Resets drop shadow
   - Resets stroke color (white) and width
   - **Note:** Preserves 'attackable-enemy' highlights (intentionally)

This is why calling `clearSelection()` at the start is so powerful - it handles ALL visual state cleanup in one call.

## üí° Key Insights

### Why "Clear First" Matters

1. **Predictability**
   - Users always see a clean slate before new highlights
   - No confusion about what's current vs what's old

2. **Simplicity**
   - One clear rule: "Always clear first"
   - Easy to remember and apply consistently

3. **Maintainability**
   - All clearing code in one place (`clearSelection()`)
   - Changes to clearing logic happen once
   - Less likely to forget clearing in new features

4. **Debugging**
   - If highlights are wrong, check calculation, not clearing
   - Clearing is guaranteed to happen first

### Design Pattern: State Management

This fix follows good state management principles:
- **Single Source of Truth**: `clearSelection()` is the authority on clearing
- **Consistency**: Same clearing logic everywhere
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clearing separate from calculation
- **Defensive Programming**: Clear even if you think it's not needed

## üêõ Additional Fix: Movable Space Images Not Showing

### Problem Discovered (After Initial Fix)
After implementing "Clear First" principle, user reported that bench deployment highlights were still not visible, even though console logs showed:
- ‚úÖ 15 destinations calculated correctly
- ‚úÖ All points receiving `valid-move` class
- ‚ùå But highlights not visible on screen!

### Root Cause: Missing `active` Class on Images
The highlighting logic was adding `valid-move` class to points, but **NOT activating the movable space images**. 

CSS behavior:
- `.movable-space-image` has `opacity: 0` by default
- `.movable-space-image.active` has `opacity: 1` (visible)
- Field robot movement adds BOTH `valid-move` AND `active` class
- Bench deployment was only adding `valid-move` class

Result: Points had the class but images stayed invisible!

### Solution: Activate Movable Space Images

**Added** (lines 16137-16144):
```javascript
// CRITICAL: Show movable space image for standard points
if (pointEl.classList.contains('standard-point')) {
    const movableImage = document.querySelector(`.movable-space-image[data-point="${pointId}"]`);
    if (movableImage) {
        movableImage.classList.add('active');
        console.log(`üé® Activated movable space image for ${pointId}`);
    }
}
```

This matches the behavior in `highlightValidMovementPoints()` (lines 16674-16680), creating consistency.

### Impact
- ‚úÖ **Movable space images now visible** when selecting bench robot
- ‚úÖ **Consistent behavior** between bench and field selection
- ‚úÖ **All 15 destinations** properly highlighted (entry points + reachable spaces)
- ‚úÖ **clearSelection() already handles cleanup** (removes `active` class)
