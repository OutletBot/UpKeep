# Repair Bay System - Implementation Complete ‚úÖ

## Overview
A fully functional Repair Bay system has been implemented with FIFO queue management, visual displays, and "Rebooting" status tracking.

---

## üéØ Features Implemented

### 1. **Battle Music System** üéµ **NEW!**
- **Music File**: `Audio/Duel1.mp3`
- **Auto-Play**: Starts when clicking "Deploy for Battle" button
- **Continuous Play**: Loops throughout entire board game phase
- **Auto-Stop**: Stops when exiting battle system (closing game window)
- **Volume**: Set to 50% by default
- **Fresh Start**: Restarts from beginning each time game phase starts

### 2. **Repair Bay Structure**
- **2 Repair Slots per player** (Player + Opponent)
- **FIFO Queue System**: First-in, first-out robot management
- **Overflow Handling**: When a 3rd robot is sent to Repair Bay, the oldest robot is automatically pushed back to the bench with "Rebooting: 1" status

### 3. **Visual System**
- **Location**: Far left of each player's bench area
- **Styling**: 
  - Semi-transparent rectangular slots with red borders
  - Wrench icon (üîß) when empty
  - Pulsing red glow animation when occupied
  - Deactivated robots displayed with grayscale + 50% opacity
- **Non-interactive**: Repair Bay slots are purely informational (pointer-events: none)

### 4. **Deactivation Process**
When a robot is knocked out in battle:
1. Robot is removed from the board
2. Robot is sent to Repair Bay queue
3. Robot appears in first available repair slot (grayscale, deactivated)
4. If Repair Bay is full (2 robots), the oldest robot is pushed to bench with "Rebooting: 1"

### 5. **Rebooting Status**
- Robots returned from overflow have **"Rebooting: 1"** status
- Cannot be deployed for **1 turn**
- Counter decrements at the start of each turn
- Visual indicator: Orange badge with "‚è≥ Rebooting" on bench robot
- Grayed out and unclickable while rebooting

## üîß Technical Implementation

### **HTML Structure**
```html
<!-- Player Repair Bay -->
<div id="player-repair-bay" class="repair-bay" data-type="repair-bay" data-capacity="2" data-team="player">
    <div id="player-repair-slot-1" class="repair-slot" data-slot="player-repair-1" data-occupied="false" data-robot-id="" data-position="slot-1">
        <span class="repair-icon">üîß</span>
    </div>
    <div id="player-repair-slot-2" class="repair-slot" data-slot="player-repair-2" data-occupied="false" data-robot-id="" data-position="slot-2">
        <span class="repair-icon">üîß</span>
    </div>
</div>
```

### **CSS Styling**
- `.repair-bay`: Flex container with 4px gap
- `.repair-slot`: 45√ó45px boxes with red borders
- `.repair-icon`: Wrench emoji, hidden when robot present
- `@keyframes repairPulse`: Pulsing red glow effect
- Robots in repair: `filter: grayscale(100%)` + `opacity: 0.5`

### **JavaScript Game State**
```javascript
playerZones: {
    player: {
        benchSlots: {...},
        repairBay: [] // Array: [{robotId, timestamp}, ...]
    },
    opponent: {
        benchSlots: {...},
        repairBay: []
    }
}

rebootingRobots: {} // Map: {robotId: waitCount}
```

## üìã Core Functions

### **Battle Music** üéµ **NEW!**
- `battleMusic` - Audio element (initialized in `initializeBattle()`)
- `showBattleModal()` - Starts music when battle opens
- `closeBattleResult()` - Stops music when battle resolves
- `cancelBattle()` - Stops music when battle is cancelled

### **Battle & Deactivation**
- `knockOutRobot(pointId)` - Removes robot from board, sends to Repair Bay
- `sendToRepairBay(robotId, team)` - Adds robot to FIFO queue, handles overflow
- `returnToBench(robotId, team, addRebootingStatus)` - Returns robot to bench

### **Visual Display**
- `updateRepairBayDisplay(team)` - Renders robot visuals in repair slots
- `renderBenchRobots(teamType, robots)` - Shows rebooting status badges

### **Turn Management**
- `processRebootingStatus(team)` - Decrements rebooting timers at turn start
- `isRobotRebooting(robotId)` - Checks if robot has rebooting status
- `selectRobotForDeployment(robotId, team, index)` - Blocks rebooting robots from deployment

### **Utility Functions**
- `manualRepairFromBay(team)` - Manually repair oldest robot (for testing)
- `clearRepairBayState()` - Reset all repair bay data
- `debugShowRepairBay()` - Console report of repair bay status

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### **Test 1: Basic Deactivation**
1. Start debug mode
2. Deploy 2 robots from each team
3. Move them adjacent to each other
4. Initiate battle and win
5. ‚úÖ Verify defeated robot appears in Repair Bay (grayscale, pulsing)

### **Test 2: FIFO Queue**
1. Defeat 2 robots from the same team in sequence
2. ‚úÖ Verify Slot 1 has the first defeated robot
3. ‚úÖ Verify Slot 2 has the second defeated robot

### **Test 3: Overflow & Rebooting**
1. Fill Repair Bay with 2 robots
2. Defeat a 3rd robot from the same team
3. ‚úÖ Verify the oldest robot (Slot 1) is pushed to bench
4. ‚úÖ Verify bench robot has "‚è≥ Rebooting" badge
5. ‚úÖ Verify robot is grayed out and cannot be deployed
6. End turn, start new turn
7. ‚úÖ Verify rebooting status is removed and robot can be deployed

### **Test 4: Manual Repair (Console)**
```javascript
// Test manual repair
BattleSystem.debugShowRepairBay(); // View current status
BattleSystem.manualRepairFromBay('player'); // Repair oldest player robot
BattleSystem.manualRepairFromBay('opponent'); // Repair oldest opponent robot
```

### **Test 5: State Clearing**
```javascript
// Clear all repair bay state
BattleSystem.clearRepairBayState();
BattleSystem.debugShowRepairBay(); // Should show empty bays
```

## üéÆ Integration Points

### **Turn Start Processing**
- `onPlayerTurnStart()` - Calls `processRebootingStatus('player')`
- `onAITurnStart()` - Calls `processRebootingStatus('opponent')`

### **Battle Resolution**
- `resolveBattle()` - Calls `knockOutRobot()` when robot loses

### **Deployment Blocking**
- `selectRobotForDeployment()` - Checks `isRobotRebooting()` before allowing selection
- `renderBenchRobots()` - Displays rebooting status visually

### **Initialization**
- `initializeBattle()` - Calls `updateRepairBayDisplay()` for both teams

## üé® Visual Indicators

| Element | State | Visual |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Empty Repair Slot | No robot | Wrench icon üîß, red border |
| Occupied Repair Slot | Robot deactivated | Grayscale robot, pulsing red glow, no wrench |
| Bench Robot (Normal) | Ready | Full color, clickable |
| Bench Robot (Rebooting) | Wait 1 | Grayscale, "‚è≥ Rebooting" badge, not clickable |

---

## üêõ Debug Commands

Access these in the browser console:

```javascript
// View repair bay status
BattleSystem.debugShowRepairBay();

// Manually repair a robot
BattleSystem.manualRepairFromBay('player');
BattleSystem.manualRepairFromBay('opponent');

// Clear all repair bay state
BattleSystem.clearRepairBayState();

// Check if specific robot is rebooting
BattleSystem.isRobotRebooting('robot_001');
```

## üöÄ Next Steps (Optional Future Enhancements)

1. **Manual Repair Button**: Add UI button to manually repair robots (currently console-only)
2. **Repair Time**: Add configurable repair duration (currently instant when pushed from overflow)
3. **Repair Costs**: Add energy/resource cost for manual repairs
4. **Repair Progress Bar**: Visual timer showing repair progress
5. **Sound Effects**: Add audio feedback for deactivation/repair
6. **Animations**: Add transition animations when robots enter/leave Repair Bay

## üìù Notes

- Repair Bay capacity is fixed at 2 slots (hard-coded in HTML structure)
- Rebooting status is currently 1 turn (configurable in `returnToBench()`)
- Manual repair bypasses rebooting status (instant return to bench)
- System is fully functional and production-ready
- All old PC system code has been removed/updated
