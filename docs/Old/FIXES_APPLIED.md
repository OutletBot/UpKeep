# ‚úÖ Game Board Fixes Applied

## üéØ Critical Issues Fixed

### **1. Board Connections - FIXED ‚úÖ**

**Problem:** Inner square was isolated - couldn't move between inner and outer areas.

**Solution:** Added bidirectional connections:

**Inner ‚Üí Outer:**
- `point-inner-tl` ‚Üî `point-top-1`, `point-left-1`
- `point-inner-tr` ‚Üî `point-top-4`, `point-right-1`
- `point-inner-bl` ‚Üî `point-bottom-1`, `point-left-3`
- `point-inner-br` ‚Üî `point-bottom-4`, `point-right-3`
- `point-inner-left` ‚Üî `point-left-2`
- `point-inner-right` ‚Üî `point-right-2`

**Inner ‚Üí Goals:**
- `point-inner-top` ‚Üî `goal-opponent`
- `point-inner-bottom` ‚Üî `goal-player`

**Entry Points:**
- All 4 entry points now properly connected to adjacent routes
- Entry points tagged with team ('player' or 'opponent')

**Result:** Full board connectivity! Can now move from any point to any other point via valid routes.

---

### **2. Movement System - FIXED ‚úÖ**

**Problem:** BFS allowed unlimited multi-hop movement, ignored blocking.

**Solution:** Rebuilt with proper step counting:

```javascript
// OLD (Wrong):
- Used BFS to find all reachable points
- Didn't properly count steps
- Could move through occupied points

// NEW (Correct):
- Each connection = 1 step
- MP = maximum number of steps
- Cannot move through occupied points (BLOCKING)
- Uses BFS but tracks distance properly
```

**Movement Rules Now Enforced:**
- ‚úÖ 3 MP = up to 3 steps along routes
- ‚úÖ 2 MP = up to 2 steps along routes  
- ‚úÖ 1 MP = only 1 step (direct neighbors)
- ‚úÖ **BLOCKING:** Cannot move through ANY occupied point
- ‚úÖ Path finding stops at occupied points

**Example:**
```
3 MP Scout at entry-bottom-left can reach:
- 1 step: point-left-1, point-bottom-1
- 2 steps: point-left-2, point-inner-tl, point-bottom-2
- 3 steps: point-left-3, point-inner-left, point-inner-bl, goal-player

But if point-left-1 is occupied:
- Can still reach point-bottom-1 (1 step)
- CANNOT reach point-left-2 (blocked)
- CANNOT reach point-left-3 (blocked)
```

### **3. Combat Resolution - FIXED ‚úÖ**

**Problem:** Missing damage/star comparisons, incomplete draw handling.

**Solution:** Complete combat matrix implementation:

**Added:**
- ‚úÖ White vs White: Compare damage values
- ‚úÖ Gold vs Gold: Compare damage values
- ‚úÖ White vs Gold: Compare damage values
- ‚úÖ **Purple vs Purple: Compare star ratings** (NEW!)
- ‚úÖ Proper draw conditions for all matchups
- ‚úÖ Detailed console logging for debugging

**Combat Matrix (Complete):**

| Attacker ‚Üì / Defender ‚Üí | Red | White | Purple | Gold | Blue |
|-------------------------|-----|-------|--------|------|------|
| **Red** | Draw | Lose | Lose | Lose | Lose |
| **White** | Win | Compare Damage | Lose | Compare Damage | Lose |
| **Purple** | Win | Win | Compare Stars ‚≠ê | Lose | Lose |
| **Gold** | Win | Compare Damage | Win | Compare Damage | Lose |
| **Blue** | Win | Win | Win | Win | Draw |

**Special Rules:**
- Same color + same value = Draw
- Blue always wins except vs Blue (draw)
- Gold beats Purple (priority attack)
- Purple beats White (special effects)
- Damage/stars determine winner when same type

## üìä What's Now Working

### ‚úÖ **Board Structure (28 Points Total)**
- 22 route points (outer rectangle + connections)
- 8 inner square points (fully connected)
- 2 goal points (connected to routes + inner)
- 4 entry points (spawn zones)
- **All points properly connected!**

### ‚úÖ **Movement System**
- MP-based step counting
- Proper blocking (can't move through occupied points)
- BFS pathfinding with distance tracking
- Visual feedback (green pulsing = valid moves)

### ‚úÖ **Combat System**
- Complete color priority hierarchy
- Damage comparison (White/Gold)
- Star rating comparison (Purple)
- Proper draw handling
- Detailed battle logging

### ‚úÖ **Debug Mode**
- Control both teams manually
- Team switching button
- Deployment restrictions
- Visual indicators

## üîÑ What Still Needs Work

### ‚è≥ **Turn Structure** (Not Yet Implemented)
According to design document, each turn should have:
1. **Module Phase** - Use Support Module (optional)
2. **Subroutine Phase** - Activate Ability (optional)
3. **Movement Phase** - Move unit (mandatory)
4. **Combat Phase** - Battle if adjacent (optional)

**Current:** Only has Movement + Combat

**Needed:**
- Add Module Phase UI
- Add Subroutine Phase UI
- Make phases irreversible (can't go back)
- First turn: -1 MP penalty

---

### ‚è≥ **Repair Bay System** (Not Yet Implemented)
**Rules:**
- 2-unit capacity
- When 3rd unit KO'd, oldest returns to bench
- Returning unit gets "Rebooting:1" status
- Can't move rebooting units next turn

**Current:** KO'd robots just disappear

**Needed:**
- Add Repair Bay slots (2 per team)
- Implement cycling logic
- Add Rebooting status
- Visual Repair Bay UI

---

### ‚è≥ **Surrounding Mechanic** (Not Yet Implemented)
**Rule:** If all adjacent points occupied by enemy = instant KO (no battle)

**Needed:**
```javascript
checkSurrounding(pointId) {
    const point = getPointById(pointId);
    const allAdjacent = point.connections;
    
    // Check if ALL adjacent points have enemy robots
    const allOccupiedByEnemy = allAdjacent.every(id => {
        const adj = getPointById(id);
        return adj.robot && adj.robot.team !== point.robot.team;
    });
    
    if (allOccupiedByEnemy) {
        // Instant KO!
        knockOutRobot(pointId);
    }
}
```

---

### ‚è≥ **Status Effects** (Not Yet Implemented)
**From Design Document:**
- Poison (damage reduction)
- Noxious (stronger poison)
- Paralysis (add Miss segment)
- Burn (damage reduction)
- Confusion (attack self)
- Sleep (can't move)
- Frozen (can't move for 3 turns)

**Needed:**
- Status effect data structure
- Apply effects after Purple moves
- Check effects before battles
- Clear effects on KO
- Visual status indicators

---

### ‚è≥ **Support Modules** (Not Yet Implemented)
**From Design Document:**
- Recalculate Trajectory (re-spin)
- Overcharge (+30 damage)
- Teleport Swap (swap positions)
- Hurdle Jump (move through units)

**Needed:**
- Module inventory system
- Module Phase UI
- Single-use enforcement
- Module effects implementation

---

### ‚è≥ **Win Conditions** (Partially Implemented)
**From Design Document:**
1. **Goal Capture** - Move unit onto opponent's goal ‚úÖ (can detect)
2. **System Lock** - Opponent has no legal moves ‚ùå (not checking)
3. **Time Out** - 5 minute timer per player ‚ùå (not implemented)

**Needed:**
- Check for goal capture after each move
- Check for System Lock at turn start
- Add timer system
- Victory/defeat UI

---

### ‚è≥ **Deployment Costs MP** (Not Yet Implemented)
**Rule:** Deploying from bench to entry point costs 1 MP

**Current:** Deployment is free

**Needed:**
- Deduct 1 MP when deploying
- This counts as the unit's move for that turn
- Can't move after deploying

---

## üéÆ How to Test Current Fixes

### **Test Board Connections:**
1. Deploy a 3 MP robot at `entry-bottom-left`
2. Select it - should see green highlights
3. Move to `point-left-1` (1 step)
4. Select again - should see `point-inner-tl` highlighted (inner square!)
5. Move to `point-inner-tl`
6. Select again - should see both inner AND outer points
7. **Success:** Can now move between inner and outer areas!

### **Test Movement Blocking:**
1. Deploy 2 robots on adjacent points
2. Deploy a 3rd robot nearby
3. Select 3rd robot
4. **Check:** Can't move through the other 2 robots
5. **Success:** Blocking works!

### **Test Combat:**
1. Move robots adjacent to each other
2. Battle triggers
3. Click "Attack"
4. **Check console:** Should see detailed combat logs
5. **Check:** Damage/star comparisons working
6. **Success:** Combat resolution correct!
