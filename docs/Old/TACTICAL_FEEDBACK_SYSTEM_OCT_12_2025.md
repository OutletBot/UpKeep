# Tactical Feedback & Safeguard System - October 12, 2025

## 🎯 Objective
Implement advanced tactical feedback to show battle opportunities clearly and add safeguards to prevent accidental premature turn endings.

---

## 📋 User Requirements

### Part 1: Battle-Ready Highlighting System
Players must see at a glance when a battle is possible:
- **Trigger moments:** After robot movement completes, or when selecting a robot on the field
- **Visual cue:** Pulsing red glow on attackable enemy robots
- **Interaction:** Clicking highlighted enemy initiates battle

### Part 2: End Turn Confirmation System
Prevent accidental turn endings with confirmation dialogs:
- **Check A:** Has player moved a robot? (mandatory action)
- **Check B:** Is a battle available? (missed opportunity warning)
- **User choice:** Yes/No buttons to confirm or cancel turn end

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### Feature 1: Enhanced Battle-Ready Highlighting

**What It Does:**
Shows a pulsing **RED GLOW** on enemy robots that are adjacent (can be attacked).

**Three Mandatory Triggers - The Complete System:**

#### TRIGGER 1: At Turn Start (CRITICAL FIX - Oct 12, 2025)
**When:** The moment a player's turn begins (after opponent ends turn)
**Action:** Global scan of entire board - checks EVERY robot belonging to current player
**Result:** All adjacent enemies immediately highlighted before player clicks anything
**Code:** `highlightAllAdjacentEnemies(team)` called in `onPlayerTurnStart()` and `onAITurnStart()`
**Lines:** 14814-14869 (function), 14378 (player), 14399 (opponent debug)

#### TRIGGER 2: When Robot Selected  
**When:** Player clicks on their robot to consider a move
**Action:** Adjacency check for that specific robot
**Result:** Adjacent enemies highlighted for that robot's battle options
**Code:** `highlightAdjacentEnemies()` called in `selectRobotForMovement()`
**Lines:** 16788-16789

#### TRIGGER 3: After Robot Moves
**When:** Robot completes movement animation and lands on new space
**Action:** Adjacency check on robot's new position
**Result:** New adjacent enemies highlighted after movement
**Code:** `highlightAdjacentEnemies()` called in `moveRobotToPoint()`
**Lines:** 17062-17063

**Visual Effect:**
```javascript
// Lines 14805-14814
circle.setAttribute('r', '60'); // Enlarged (DOUBLED)
circle.style.filter = 'drop-shadow(0 0 20px rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.9))'; // RED glow
circle.setAttribute('stroke', '#ff0000'); // Red border
circle.setAttribute('stroke-width', '8'); // Thick border
```

**CSS Animation** (lines 4055-4068):
```css
@keyframes attackableEnemyPulse {
    0%, 100% { 
        filter: drop-shadow(0 0 15px rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.7));
        transform: scale(1);
    }
    50% { 
        filter: drop-shadow(0 0 25px rgba(255, 0, 0, 1));
        transform: scale(1.05);
    }
}

.attackable-enemy circle {
    animation: attackableEnemyPulse 1s ease-in-out infinite;
}
```

**Battle Log Integration:**
When enemies are highlighted, a message appears in battle log:
```
"⚔️ 2 adjacent enemies available for battle!"
```

---

### Feature 2: End Turn Confirmation System

**How It Works:**
When player clicks "End Turn" button, system performs hierarchical checks:

#### Check A: Has Player Moved a Robot?

**Code** (lines 14920-14927):
```javascript
if (!this.turnActions.hasMovedRobot) {
    console.log('⚠️ No move made this turn - showing confirmation');
    const confirmed = confirm('You have not moved a robot this turn. Are you sure you want to end your turn?');
    if (!confirmed) {
        console.log('❌ Turn end cancelled by user');
        return; // User chose not to end turn
    }
}
```

**Prompt:**
```
"You have not moved a robot this turn. Are you sure you want to end your turn?"
[OK] [Cancel]
```

**When:** Player tries to end turn without moving/deploying any robot.

#### Check B: Is a Battle Available?

**Code** (lines 14929-14941):
```javascript
if (this.turnActions.hasMovedRobot && !this.turnActions.hasBattled) {
    const hasBattles = this.hasAnyBattleOpportunities(currentTeam);
    if (hasBattles) {
        console.log('⚠️ Battle opportunities available - showing confirmation');
        const confirmed = confirm('You have an opportunity to battle an opponent. Are you sure you want to end your turn without attacking?');
        if (!confirmed) {
            console.log('❌ Turn end cancelled by user');
            return; // User chose not to end turn
        }
    }
}
```

**Prompt:**
```
"You have an opportunity to battle an opponent. Are you sure you want to end your turn without attacking?"
[OK] [Cancel]
```

**When:** Player has moved but there are adjacent enemies available to attack.

---

### Supporting Function: hasAnyBattleOpportunities()

**Purpose:** Scan entire board to check if ANY of the current team's robots have adjacent enemies.

**Code** (lines 14890-14912):
```javascript
hasAnyBattleOpportunities(team) {
    // Check all points for robots of this team
    const allPoints = [
        ...Object.entries(this.gameBoard.entryPoints),
        ...Object.entries(this.gameBoard.routePoints),
        ...Object.entries(this.gameBoard.innerPoints),
        ...Object.entries(this.gameBoard.goalPoints)
    ];
    
    for (const [pointId, pointData] of allPoints) {
        if (pointData.robot && pointData.robot.team === team) {
            // This robot belongs to the current team, check for adjacent enemies
            const adjacentEnemies = this.getAdjacentEnemies(pointId, team);
            if (adjacentEnemies.length > 0) {
                console.log(`⚔️ Battle opportunity found: ${pointData.robot.id} at ${pointId}`);
                return true; // Found at least one battle opportunity
            }
        }
    }
    
    console.log(`✅ No battle opportunities available for ${team}`);
    return false; // No battle opportunities
}
```

**How It Works:**
1. Iterates through ALL board points
2. Finds robots belonging to current team
3. Checks each robot for adjacent enemies
4. Returns true if ANY robot has battle opportunity

## 💡 Key Insights

### Design Principles Applied

1. **Proactive Feedback**
   - Don't wait for player to ask "can I battle?"
   - SHOW them immediately with red glow
   - Make tactical information obvious

2. **Safeguards Without Annoyance**
   - Only show dialogs when needed
   - If all actions taken → no prompt
   - Respects player's time and flow

3. **Clear Visual Language**
   - Red = Enemy/Danger/Attack
   - Pulsing = Interactive/Clickable
   - Size change = Important/Emphasized

4. **Confirmation Hierarchy**
   - Most critical first (no move)
   - Secondary next (missed opportunity)
   - Nothing if everything's fine

### UX Improvements

**Before these features:**
- Players relied on mental tracking
- Easy to miss tactical opportunities
- Accidental turn endings were possible
- Lacked professional polish

**After these features:**
- **Visual clarity** - see opportunities at a glance

## 🔧 Critical Update: Turn Start Highlighting (Oct 12, 2025)

### The Problem Reported
User reported: "Upon my fresh turn, I am next to a robot I can battle but it's not being highlighted."

**Root Cause:** Battle highlighting was only triggered when:
- ✅ Selecting a robot (TRIGGER 2)
- ✅ After robot moves (TRIGGER 3)
- ❌ **Missing at turn start** (TRIGGER 1)

Result: If you started your turn with a robot already next to an enemy (from previous positioning), the enemy wasn't highlighted until you clicked something.

### The Solution: Three-Trigger System

**Added TRIGGER 1: Global Board Scan at Turn Start**

**New Function** (lines 14814-14869):
```javascript
highlightAllAdjacentEnemies(team) {
    // Scan ALL points on the board
    const allPoints = [
        ...Object.entries(this.gameBoard.entryPoints),
        ...Object.entries(this.gameBoard.routePoints),
        ...Object.entries(this.gameBoard.innerPoints),
        ...Object.entries(this.gameBoard.goalPoints)
    ];
    
    let totalEnemiesHighlighted = 0;
    
    // Check each robot belonging to current team
    for (const [pointId, pointData] of allPoints) {
        if (pointData.robot && pointData.robot.team === team) {
            // Check for adjacent enemies
            const adjacentEnemies = this.getAdjacentEnemies(pointId, team);
            if (adjacentEnemies.length > 0) {
                // Highlight each adjacent enemy with RED GLOW
                adjacentEnemies.forEach(enemyPointId => {
                    // Apply attackable-enemy class and visual effects
                    // (Prevents duplicates with classList check)
                });
                totalEnemiesHighlighted++;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Show battle log message if enemies found
    if (totalEnemiesHighlighted > 0) {
        this.addToHistory(`⚔️ ${totalEnemiesHighlighted} attackable enemies on the board!`);
    }
}
```

**Called in Turn Start Functions:**
```javascript
// Player turn start (line 14378)
onPlayerTurnStart() {
    // ... existing code ...
    this.highlightAllAdjacentEnemies('player'); // TRIGGER 1
}

// AI/Opponent turn start in debug mode (line 14399)
onAITurnStart() {
    if (this.debugMode) {
        // ... existing code ...
        this.highlightAllAdjacentEnemies('opponent'); // TRIGGER 1
    }
}
```

### What Changed

**Before:**
- ❌ Turn starts → No highlighting
- ✅ Click robot → Enemies highlighted (TRIGGER 2)
- ✅ Move robot → New enemies highlighted (TRIGGER 3)

**After:**
- ✅ **Turn starts → ALL adjacent enemies immediately highlighted** (TRIGGER 1)
- ✅ Click robot → Enemies highlighted (TRIGGER 2)
- ✅ Move robot → New enemies highlighted (TRIGGER 3)

### Impact

**Tactical Awareness:**
- Player instantly sees ALL battle opportunities when turn begins
- No need to click around to discover attackable enemies
- "Chess-like" strategic experience - see the board state immediately

**User Experience:**
- ✅ No missed opportunities
- ✅ Clear tactical information from turn start
- ✅ Consistent with "Inviolable Rule" - adjacent enemies ALWAYS highlighted
- ✅ Professional, polished feel

**Console Logs:**
```
🔍 TRIGGER 1 - TURN START: Scanning all player robots for adjacent enemies...
  🤖 Checking unit-001-uc-0 at point-inner-left...
    ⚡ Found 1 adjacent enemies!
      🔴 Highlighted enemy at point-inner-tl
✅ TURN START: Highlighted 1 attackable enemy
```

**Battle Log Message:**
```
⚔️ 1 attackable enemy on the board!
```

### The Three-Trigger System is Now Complete

| Trigger | When | Purpose | Status |
|---------|------|---------|--------|
| **TRIGGER 1** | Turn Start | Show all existing battle opportunities | ✅ FIXED |
| **TRIGGER 2** | Robot Selected | Show selected robot's battle options | ✅ Working |
| **TRIGGER 3** | After Movement | Show new battle opportunities | ✅ Working |

**Result:** Battle highlighting is **ALWAYS** functioning, no matter when or how the tactical situation arises.

## 🔒 Critical Update: "Lock-In" System (Oct 12, 2025)

### The "One Action Per Turn" Principle

**User Requirement:** Once a player moves a robot, their turn must conclude. Only that robot can battle. All other robots become locked out.

### The Problem
Previous implementation allowed confusing behavior:
- Move Robot B → Robot A (next to enemy) was still considered in battle checks
- End Turn prompt would mention Robot A's battle opportunities
- This violated the core "one action per turn" rule

### The Solution: Complete Lock-In System

**What It Does:**
1. **After moving Robot B:**
   - Robot A becomes unselectable
   - Robot A cannot battle
   - Only Robot B's battle opportunities are considered
   - Visual highlights clear and refocus on Robot B only

#### Component 1: Robot Selection Lock

**Location:** `selectRobotForMovement()` line 16754

**Code:**
```javascript
if (this.turnActions.hasMovedRobot) {
    console.log('⚠️ Cannot select robot - already moved/deployed a robot this turn!');
    this.showTurnActionMessage('You can only move ONE robot per turn!');
    return; // BLOCKS selection
}
```

**Effect:** After moving Robot B, clicking Robot A does nothing - selection is blocked.

#### Component 2: Battle Lock

**Location:** `initiateBattle()` line 17149-17155

**Code:**
```javascript
// LOCK-IN CHECK: If a robot has moved, only that robot can battle
if (this.turnActions.lastMovedRobotPoint && this.turnActions.lastMovedRobotPoint !== attackerPointId) {
    console.log(`🔒 LOCK-IN ENFORCED: Cannot battle with robot at ${attackerPointId}`);
    console.log(`   Only robot at ${this.turnActions.lastMovedRobotPoint} (the one that moved) can battle this turn`);
    this.showTurnActionMessage(`You can only battle with the robot you just moved! (at ${this.turnActions.lastMovedRobotPoint})`);
    return; // BLOCKS battle
}
```

**Effect:** After moving Robot B to point X, only robot at point X can initiate battles. Robot A's battles are blocked.

#### Component 3: Tracking System

**New Field:** `turnActions.lastMovedRobotPoint`

**Set in three locations:**
1. `moveRobotToPoint()` line 17037
2. `deployRobotToPoint()` line 16454
3. `smartDeployRobotToPoint()` line 16601

**Code Pattern:**
```javascript
this.turnActions.lastMovedRobotPoint = toPointId; // LOCK-IN: Only this robot can battle
console.log(`🔒 LOCK-IN: Only robot at ${toPointId} can battle this turn`);
```

**Cleared:** Line 15037 in `endPlayerTurn()` when turn ends

#### Component 4: Focused Adjacency Check

**Location:** After movement/deployment

**Code Pattern:**
```javascript
// LOCK-IN: Clear ALL battle highlights first (important!)
this.clearAttackableEnemies();

// TRIGGER 3: Highlight ONLY adjacent enemies for the robot that just moved
const adjacentEnemies = this.highlightAdjacentEnemies(toPointId, movementData.team);
```

**Applied in:**
- `moveRobotToPoint()` lines 17085-17089
- `deployRobotToPoint()` lines 16488-16492
- `smartDeployRobotToPoint()` lines 16611-16615

**Effect:** After moving Robot B, all old highlights clear. Only Robot B's adjacent enemies are shown.

#### Component 5: Refined End Turn Checks

**Location:** `endPlayerTurn()` lines 15015-15042

**Code:**
```javascript
// CONFIRMATION SYSTEM: TWO-TIER CHECK

// Check A: Has a move been made?
if (!this.turnActions.hasMovedRobot) {
    console.log('⚠️ CHECK A: No move made this turn - showing confirmation');
    const confirmed = confirm('You have not moved a robot this turn. Are you sure you want to end your turn?');
    if (!confirmed) {
        console.log('❌ Turn end cancelled by user (Check A)');
        return;
    }
}

// Check B: If a robot was moved, does IT have adjacent enemies to battle?
if (this.turnActions.hasMovedRobot && this.turnActions.lastMovedRobotPoint && !this.turnActions.hasBattled) {
    console.log('⚠️ CHECK B: Move made, checking for battle opportunities...');
    const adjacentEnemies = this.getAdjacentEnemies(this.turnActions.lastMovedRobotPoint, currentTeam);
    
    if (adjacentEnemies.length > 0) {
        console.log(`⚠️ CHECK B: ${adjacentEnemies.length} adjacent enemies available to attack!`);
        const confirmed = confirm(`You can still attack ${adjacentEnemies.length} adjacent enemy! Are you sure?`);
        if (!confirmed) {
            console.log('❌ Turn end cancelled by user (Check B - battle available)');
            return;
        }
    }
}
```

**Key Change:** Check B now uses `lastMovedRobotPoint` - only checks the robot that moved, ignores all others.

### Complete Turn Flow

**Scenario: Robot A next to enemy, you move Robot B**

1. **Turn Start:**
   - Trigger 1 fires → Robot A's adjacent enemy highlighted
   - Player sees all battle opportunities

2. **Select Robot B:**
   - Old highlights clear
   - Robot B selected for movement

3. **Move Robot B:**
   - `lastMovedRobotPoint` = Robot B's position (LOCK-IN)
   - All highlights clear
   - Only Robot B's adjacent enemies highlighted
   - Robot A is now locked out

4. **Auto-End or Manual End:**
   - **If Robot B has no enemies:** Turn auto-ends (500ms delay)
   - **If Robot B has enemies:** Player can battle or click "End Turn"

5. **If Player Clicks "End Turn":**
   - Check A: Skipped (move was made)
   - Check B: Only checks Robot B's enemies
   - **Robot A is never mentioned**

6. **If Player Tries to Battle with Robot A:**
   - Lock-in check blocks it
   - Message: "You can only battle with the robot you just moved!"

7. **If Player Tries to Select Robot A:**
   - Selection blocked
   - Message: "You can only move ONE robot per turn!"

### What Changed vs. Previous Version

**Before Lock-In:**
- ❌ Check B scanned entire board (all robots)
- ❌ Would warn about Robot A's battles after moving Robot B
- ❌ Confusing and violated "one action" rule

**After Lock-In:**
- ✅ Check B only checks `lastMovedRobotPoint`
- ✅ Ignores all other robots' battle opportunities
- ✅ Only the moved robot can battle
- ✅ Clear, focused tactical feedback

### Technical Summary

| Component | Location | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Selection Lock | `selectRobotForMovement()` 16754 | Blocks selecting other robots |
| Battle Lock | `initiateBattle()` 17149-17155 | Blocks battles with other robots |
| Tracking | `turnActions.lastMovedRobotPoint` | Records which robot moved |
| Focused Check | After move/deploy | Only highlight moved robot's enemies |
| Refined Prompt | `endPlayerTurn()` 15027-15042 | Only warn about moved robot's battles |

### Timing Fix: Turn Start Highlighting

**Issue:** Sometimes turn start highlighting didn't work - DOM not ready.

**Solution:** Added 100ms delay before scanning:

```javascript
// Lines 14379-14381 (player), 14403-14405 (opponent)
setTimeout(() => {
    this.highlightAllAdjacentEnemies('player');
}, 100);
```

**Effect:** Reliable highlighting at turn start - DOM fully rendered.

### Result

✅ **"One Action Per Turn" Rule Fully Enforced**
- After moving a robot, all other robots locked out
- Only moved robot can battle
- Only moved robot considered in end turn checks
- Clear, focused visual feedback
- No confusing prompts about other robots

---

**Last Updated:** October 12, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Lock-In system complete - "One Action Per Turn" fully enforced  
**Result:** Professional tactical experience with strict rule enforcement and clear feedback
