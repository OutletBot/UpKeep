# Repair Bay FIFO Cycle - Test Scenario & Verification

## 🎯 **Core Mechanic: "First-In, First-Out" System**

The Repair Bay operates as a **strict 2-slot queue** with automatic overflow management. This test document verifies the complete cycle works as intended.

---

## 📋 **The Complete Cycle (Step-by-Step)**

### **Initial State**
```
Player Repair Bay: [Empty] [Empty]
Player Bench: [Robot A] [Robot B] [Robot C] [Robot D] [Robot E] [Robot F]
```

---

### **Step 1: First Deactivation**
**Action**: Robot A is defeated in battle  
**Expected Result**:
```
Repair Bay: [Robot A 🔧] [Empty]
Bench: [Robot B] [Robot C] [Robot D] [Robot E] [Robot F] [Empty slot]

✅ Robot A occupies Slot 1
✅ Robot A appears grayscale with pulsing red glow
✅ Wrench icon hidden in Slot 1
✅ Slot 2 still shows wrench icon
```

**Console Verification**:
```javascript
BattleSystem.debugShowRepairBay();
// Should show:
// 👤 Player Repair Bay (1/2):
//   [1] Robot A - waiting since [timestamp]
```

---

### **Step 2: Second Deactivation**
**Action**: Robot B is defeated in battle  
**Expected Result**:
```
Repair Bay: [Robot A 🔧] [Robot B 🔧]  ← FULL!
Bench: [Robot C] [Robot D] [Robot E] [Robot F] [Empty] [Empty]

✅ Robot A still in Slot 1 (oldest)
✅ Robot B occupies Slot 2 (newest)
✅ Both robots grayscale with pulsing red glow
✅ Both wrench icons hidden
✅ Bay is now at maximum capacity
```

**Console Verification**:
```javascript
BattleSystem.debugShowRepairBay();
// Should show:
// 👤 Player Repair Bay (2/2):
//   [1] Robot A - waiting since [timestamp1]
//   [2] Robot B - waiting since [timestamp2]
```

---

### **Step 3: Third Deactivation - THE CRITICAL OVERFLOW**
**Action**: Robot C is defeated in battle  
**Expected Result**:

#### **Phase A: Overflow Triggered**
```
Console Log:
🔧 Sending robot_003 to player Repair Bay
   Current bay status: 2/2 slots occupied
⚠️ Repair Bay overflow! Pushing oldest robot back to bench...
```

#### **Phase B: Robot A Pushed to Bench**
```
Console Log:
♻️ Returning robot_001 to player bench
⏳ robot_001 has "Rebooting: 1" status - cannot deploy next turn
♻️ Robot A returned to bench (Rebooting: 1)
```

#### **Phase C: Final State**
```
Repair Bay: [Robot B 🔧] [Robot C 🔧]
Bench: [Robot D] [Robot E] [Robot F] [Empty] [Empty] [Robot A ⏳]

✅ Robot A pushed to bench (FIRST IN → FIRST OUT)
✅ Robot A has "Rebooting: 1" status
✅ Robot A appears grayed out on bench
✅ Robot A shows orange "⏳ Rebooting" badge
✅ Robot B moved from Slot 2 to Slot 1
✅ Robot C (newly defeated) occupies Slot 2
✅ Clicking Robot A does NOTHING (blocked)
```

**Console Verification**:
```javascript
BattleSystem.debugShowRepairBay();
// Should show:
// 👤 Player Repair Bay (2/2):
//   [1] Robot B - waiting since [timestamp2]
//   [2] Robot C - waiting since [timestamp3]
//
// ⏳ Rebooting Robots:
//   Robot A: 1 turn(s) remaining

BattleSystem.isRobotRebooting('robot_001');
// Should return: true
```

---

### **Step 4: Turn Passes - Rebooting Timer Decrements**
**Action**: End turn → Opponent's turn → End opponent turn → Your turn starts  
**Expected Result**:

```
Console Log (at turn start):
⏳ Processing Rebooting status for player...
  robot_001: Rebooting timer 1 → 0 (CLEARED)
✅ robot_001 is now ready for action
```

```
Bench: [Robot D] [Robot E] [Robot F] [Empty] [Empty] [Robot A ✅]

✅ Robot A no longer shows "⏳ Rebooting" badge
✅ Robot A is now full color and clickable
✅ Robot A can be deployed normally
```

**Console Verification**:
```javascript
BattleSystem.debugShowRepairBay();
// Should show:
// ⏳ Rebooting Robots:
//   (none)

BattleSystem.isRobotRebooting('robot_001');
// Should return: false
```

---

### **Step 5: Fourth Deactivation - Cycle Repeats**
**Action**: Robot D is defeated in battle  
**Expected Result**:

```
Repair Bay: [Robot C 🔧] [Robot D 🔧]
Bench: [Robot E] [Robot F] [Empty] [Empty] [Robot A] [Robot B ⏳]

✅ Robot B pushed to bench (FIRST IN → FIRST OUT)
✅ Robot B has "Rebooting: 1" status
✅ Cycle continues indefinitely
```

## 🧪 **Complete Test Procedure**

### **Test 1: Basic FIFO Verification**
```javascript
// 1. Start debug mode
BattleSystem.enableDebugMode();

// 2. Deploy 3 robots from player team to board
// 3. Deploy 3 robots from opponent team adjacent to player robots

// 4. Defeat Player Robot 1
// Verify: Shows in Repair Bay Slot 1

// 5. Defeat Player Robot 2
// Verify: Shows in Repair Bay Slot 2

// 6. Check Repair Bay status
BattleSystem.debugShowRepairBay();
// Expected: Both slots occupied, Robot 1 in Slot 1, Robot 2 in Slot 2

// 7. Defeat Player Robot 3
// Verify: 
// - Console shows "Repair Bay overflow!"
// - Robot 1 appears on bench with "⏳ Rebooting" badge
// - Repair Bay now shows Robot 2 in Slot 1, Robot 3 in Slot 2

// 8. Try to deploy Robot 1
// Expected: Blocked, console shows "Cannot deploy - robot is rebooting"

// 9. End turn twice (opponent turn + back to player)
// Verify: Robot 1 no longer has rebooting badge and can be deployed
```

### **Test 2: Rebooting Status Verification**
```javascript
// After Robot 1 returns to bench with "Rebooting: 1":

// 1. Check status
BattleSystem.isRobotRebooting('robot_001'); // Should return: true

// 2. Try to deploy
// Click on Robot 1 in bench
// Expected: No response, history shows "robot_001 is rebooting - cannot deploy this turn"

// 3. End turn → Start new turn
BattleSystem.processRebootingStatus('player'); // Manual test

// 4. Check status again
BattleSystem.isRobotRebooting('robot_001'); // Should return: false

// 5. Deploy Robot 1
// Expected: Works normally
```

### **Test 3: Visual Verification Checklist**
- [ ] Empty Repair Bay slots show wrench icon 🔧
- [ ] Occupied slots hide wrench icon
- [ ] Robots in Repair Bay are grayscale (100%)
- [ ] Robots in Repair Bay have 50% opacity
- [ ] Occupied Repair Bay slots pulse with red glow
- [ ] Rebooting robots on bench have orange "⏳ Rebooting" badge
- [ ] Rebooting robots on bench are grayed out (40% opacity, 80% grayscale)
- [ ] Rebooting robots cannot be clicked
- [ ] Normal bench robots are full color and clickable

### **Test 4: Multiple Overflow Test**
```javascript
// Defeat 6 robots in sequence from same team
// Expected cycle:
// Robot 1 → Bay Slot 1
// Robot 2 → Bay Slot 2
// Robot 3 → Bay overflow → Robot 1 to bench (Rebooting)
// Robot 4 → Bay overflow → Robot 2 to bench (Rebooting)
// Robot 5 → Bay overflow → Robot 3 to bench (Rebooting)
// Robot 6 → Bay overflow → Robot 4 to bench (Rebooting)

// Final state: Robot 5 and 6 in Repair Bay, Robots 1-4 on bench
// Expected: Robots 1-4 all have "Rebooting: 1" initially

// End turn twice
// Expected: All rebooting statuses cleared
```

2. **Expected**: 
   - Battle modal opens
   - Music starts playing from beginning
   - Console shows: "🎵 Battle music started"
   - Music loops continuously

### **Test 2: Music Stops on Battle Resolution**

## 🐛 **Debug Commands Reference**

```javascript
// View complete Repair Bay status
BattleSystem.debugShowRepairBay();

// Check if specific robot is rebooting
BattleSystem.isRobotRebooting('robot_001');

// Manually repair oldest robot (skip rebooting status)
BattleSystem.manualRepairFromBay('player');
BattleSystem.manualRepairFromBay('opponent');

// Clear all Repair Bay state (reset)
BattleSystem.clearRepairBayState();

// Process rebooting status manually
BattleSystem.processRebootingStatus('player');
BattleSystem.processRebootingStatus('opponent');

// Control music manually
BattleSystem.battleMusic.play();
BattleSystem.battleMusic.pause();
BattleSystem.battleMusic.volume = 0.7; // Adjust volume (0.0 to 1.0)
```
