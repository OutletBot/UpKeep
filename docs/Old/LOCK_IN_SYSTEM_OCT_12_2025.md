# "One Action Per Turn" Lock-In System - October 12, 2025

## üéØ Core Principle

**The Inviolable Rule:** Once a player moves a robot, their turn is locked to that robot only. All other robots become unselectable and cannot battle. The turn must conclude either by battling with the moved robot or by ending the turn.

---

## üìã User Requirements

### The Problem
**Scenario:** You have Robot A next to an enemy. You move Robot B to a different location.

**Previous Behavior (WRONG):**
- ‚ùå Robot A was still considered for battle opportunities
- ‚ùå End Turn prompt would mention Robot A's battles
- ‚ùå Violated "one action per turn" rule
- ‚ùå Confusing and inconsistent

**Required Behavior (CORRECT):**
- ‚úÖ Only Robot B (the moved robot) matters after the move
- ‚úÖ Robot A becomes completely locked out
- ‚úÖ Robot A cannot be selected
- ‚úÖ Robot A cannot battle
- ‚úÖ End Turn checks ignore Robot A entirely

---

## ‚úÖ Implementation: Complete Lock-In System

### Component 1: Robot Selection Lock

**Location:** `selectRobotForMovement()` line 16754

**What It Does:** Prevents selecting any robot after one has moved.

**Code:**
```javascript
if (this.turnActions.hasMovedRobot) {
    console.log('‚ö†Ô∏è Cannot select robot - already moved/deployed a robot this turn!');
    this.showTurnActionMessage('You can only move ONE robot per turn! End your turn to continue.');
    return; // BLOCKS selection completely
}
```

**Effect:**
- After moving Robot B, clicking Robot A does nothing
- Message appears in battle log: "You can only move ONE robot per turn!"
- Selection is completely blocked

---

### Component 2: Battle Lock

**Location:** `initiateBattle()` lines 17149-17155

**What It Does:** Only allows the moved robot to initiate battles.

**Code:**
```javascript
// LOCK-IN CHECK: If a robot has moved, only that robot can battle
if (this.turnActions.lastMovedRobotPoint && this.turnActions.lastMovedRobotPoint !== attackerPointId) {
    console.log(`üîí LOCK-IN ENFORCED: Cannot battle with robot at ${attackerPointId}`);
    console.log(`   Only robot at ${this.turnActions.lastMovedRobotPoint} (the one that moved) can battle this turn`);
    this.showTurnActionMessage(`You can only battle with the robot you just moved! (at ${this.turnActions.lastMovedRobotPoint})`);
    return; // BLOCKS battle
}
```

**Effect:**
- After moving Robot B to point X, only robot at point X can click enemies
- If Robot A tries to battle, it's blocked
- Message appears: "You can only battle with the robot you just moved!"

---

### Component 3: Tracking System

**New State Variable:** `turnActions.lastMovedRobotPoint`

**Initialized:** Line 15341
```javascript
turnActions: {
    hasMovedRobot: false,
    hasBattled: false,
    actionTakenThisTurn: false,
    lastMovedRobotPoint: null // Track which robot just moved (for "lock-in")
}
```

**Set in Three Locations:**

1. **After Moving Robot** - Line 17037
```javascript
this.turnActions.lastMovedRobotPoint = toPointId; // LOCK-IN: Only this robot can battle
console.log(`üîí LOCK-IN: Only robot at ${toPointId} can battle this turn`);
```

2. **After Deploying Robot (Standard)** - Line 16454
```javascript
this.turnActions.lastMovedRobotPoint = pointId; // LOCK-IN: Only this robot can battle
console.log(`üîí LOCK-IN: Only robot at ${pointId} can battle this turn`);
```

3. **After Deploying Robot (Smart)** - Line 16601
```javascript
this.turnActions.lastMovedRobotPoint = finalDestinationId; // LOCK-IN: Only this robot can battle
console.log(`üîí LOCK-IN: Only robot at ${finalDestinationId} can battle this turn`);
```

**Cleared:** Line 15037 in `endPlayerTurn()`
```javascript
this.turnActions.lastMovedRobotPoint = null; // Clear lock-in
```

---

### Component 4: Focused Adjacency Check

**Purpose:** After a move, clear ALL battle highlights and show only the moved robot's enemies.

**Applied in Three Locations:**

1. **After Robot Movement** - Lines 17085-17089
```javascript
// LOCK-IN: Clear ALL battle highlights first (important!)
this.clearAttackableEnemies();

// TRIGGER 3: Highlight ONLY adjacent enemies for the robot that just moved
const adjacentEnemies = this.highlightAdjacentEnemies(toPointId, movementData.team);
```

2. **After Standard Deployment** - Lines 16488-16492
```javascript
// LOCK-IN: Clear ALL battle highlights first (important!)
this.clearAttackableEnemies();

// Check for adjacent enemies ONLY for deployed robot
const adjacentEnemies = this.highlightAdjacentEnemies(pointId, deploymentData.teamType);
```

3. **After Smart Deployment** - Lines 16611-16615
```javascript
// LOCK-IN: Clear ALL battle highlights first (important!)
this.clearAttackableEnemies();

// Check for adjacent enemies ONLY for deployed robot
const adjacentEnemies = this.highlightAdjacentEnemies(finalDestinationId, deploymentData.teamType);
```

**Effect:**
- All red glows on enemies disappear
- Only enemies adjacent to the moved robot are re-highlighted
- Visual feedback is clear: "these are your only battle options now"

---

### Component 5: Refined End Turn Checks

**Location:** `endPlayerTurn()` lines 15015-15042

**What Changed:** Check B now only considers the moved robot, not all robots on the board.

**Code:**
```javascript
// CONFIRMATION SYSTEM: TWO-TIER CHECK

// Check A: Has a move been made?
if (!this.turnActions.hasMovedRobot) {
    console.log('‚ö†Ô∏è CHECK A: No move made this turn - showing confirmation');
    const confirmed = confirm('You have not moved a robot this turn. Are you sure you want to end your turn?');
    if (!confirmed) {
        console.log('‚ùå Turn end cancelled by user (Check A)');
        return;
    }
}

// Check B: If a robot was moved, does IT have adjacent enemies to battle?
if (this.turnActions.hasMovedRobot && this.turnActions.lastMovedRobotPoint && !this.turnActions.hasBattled) {
    console.log('‚ö†Ô∏è CHECK B: Move made, checking for battle opportunities...');
    const adjacentEnemies = this.getAdjacentEnemies(this.turnActions.lastMovedRobotPoint, currentTeam);
    
    if (adjacentEnemies.length > 0) {
        console.log(`‚ö†Ô∏è CHECK B: ${adjacentEnemies.length} adjacent ${adjacentEnemies.length === 1 ? 'enemy' : 'enemies'} available to attack!`);
        const confirmed = confirm(`You can still attack ${adjacentEnemies.length} adjacent ${adjacentEnemies.length === 1 ? 'enemy' : 'enemies'}! Are you sure you want to end your turn?`);
        if (!confirmed) {
            console.log('‚ùå Turn end cancelled by user (Check B - battle available)');
            return;
        }
        console.log('‚úÖ User confirmed - ending turn despite battle opportunity');
    } else {
        console.log('‚úÖ CHECK B: No adjacent enemies - proceeding to end turn');
    }
}
```

**Key Difference:**
```javascript
// OLD (WRONG): Scanned entire board
const hasBattles = this.hasAnyBattleOpportunities(currentTeam);

// NEW (CORRECT): Only checks moved robot
const adjacentEnemies = this.getAdjacentEnemies(this.turnActions.lastMovedRobotPoint, currentTeam);
```

## üéÆ Complete Turn Flow

### Scenario: Robot A is next to enemy, you move Robot B

**Step 1: Turn Starts**
- Trigger 1 fires (100ms delay)
- Global scan highlights Robot A's adjacent enemy
- Player sees all battle opportunities clearly

**Step 2: Player Selects Robot B**
- `selectRobotForMovement()` called
- Old highlights clear
- Robot B's valid moves shown
- Robot B selected for movement

**Step 3: Player Moves Robot B**
- `moveRobotToPoint()` executes
- **LOCK-IN ACTIVATES:**
  - `hasMovedRobot` = true
  - `lastMovedRobotPoint` = Robot B's new position
- All highlights clear (`clearAttackableEnemies()`)
- Only Robot B's adjacent enemies highlighted
- Console log: "üîí LOCK-IN: Only robot at [B's position] can battle this turn"

**Step 4: Auto-End or Manual End**

**IF Robot B has no adjacent enemies:**
- Console: "‚è© No adjacent enemies - auto-ending turn"
- 500ms delay for UX
- Turn ends automatically
- No prompts

**IF Robot B has adjacent enemies:**
- Enemies glow red
- Battle log: "Robot moved! You can battle X adjacent enemies or end your turn."
- Player has two choices:
  1. Click glowing enemy ‚Üí Battle initiates ‚Üí Turn ends
  2. Click "End Turn" ‚Üí Proceeds to Step 5

**Step 5: Player Clicks "End Turn" (with Robot B's enemies available)**
- Check A: Skipped (move was made)
- Check B: `getAdjacentEnemies(lastMovedRobotPoint)` called
  - **Only checks Robot B** (not Robot A)
  - Finds Robot B has enemies
  - Prompt: "You can still attack X adjacent enemies! Are you sure?"
  - **Robot A is never mentioned**
- Player clicks OK ‚Üí Turn ends
- Player clicks Cancel ‚Üí Returns to game, can still battle with Robot B

**Step 6: Player Tries to Select Robot A**
- `selectRobotForMovement()` called
- Check at line 16754: `if (hasMovedRobot)`
- **Selection BLOCKED**
- Battle log: "You can only move ONE robot per turn!"
- Robot A remains unselected

**Step 7: Player Tries to Battle with Robot A**
- `initiateBattle(Robot A's point, enemy point)` called
- Check at line 17149: `if (lastMovedRobotPoint !== attackerPointId)`
- **Battle BLOCKED**
- Battle log: "You can only battle with the robot you just moved!"
- No battle initiates

## üîç Before vs. After Comparison

### Before Lock-In System

**Scenario: Robot A next to enemy, move Robot B**

‚ùå **End Turn Check:**
```javascript
// Scanned ALL robots on board
for each robot:
    if has adjacent enemies:
        return true
// Would find Robot A's enemy even though we moved Robot B
```

‚ùå **Result:**
- Prompt: "You have an opportunity to battle. Are you sure?"
- Player confused: "I can't battle with Robot B, it has no enemies!"
- Violated "one action per turn" rule

### After Lock-In System

**Scenario: Robot A next to enemy, move Robot B**

‚úÖ **End Turn Check:**
```javascript
// Only check the robot that moved (Robot B)
const adjacentEnemies = this.getAdjacentEnemies(lastMovedRobotPoint, team);
// Only finds Robot B's enemies (if any)
// Ignores Robot A completely
```

‚úÖ **Result:**
- If Robot B has no enemies: No prompt, turn ends cleanly
- If Robot B has enemies: Prompt mentions Robot B's count only
- Robot A is never mentioned
- "One action per turn" rule respected
