# Combat Dial Tap-and-Hold Feature - Session Continuation

## Current Status
**Date:** 2025-10-14 01:24 AM UTC-06:00  
**Feature:** Tap-and-hold to view robot Combat Dial info  
**Status:** üîß In Progress - Timer cancelling too early

## Problem
- Touch/mouse events fire correctly
- Timer starts: `‚è±Ô∏è Started hold timer for unit-001-uc-0 (500ms)`
- But user releases before 500ms ‚Üí timer cancelled
- No Combat Dial info opens

## Solution COMPLETED ‚úÖ
1. ‚úÖ **Reduced hold time** from 500ms to 250ms (0.25s = MUCH easier to trigger!)
2. ‚úÖ **Fixed coordinate storage** - Using `element.dataset` for shared state
3. ‚úÖ **Increased movement threshold** - 30px tolerance before cancelling
4. ‚úÖ **FIXED EVENT BUBBLING BUG** - Only attach to group, not circle (was causing timer resets!)
5. ‚úÖ **FIXED HANDLER TRACKING BUG** - Use element properties instead of attributes!

## Root Causes Found

### Bug #1: Event Bubbling
**Problem**: Handlers attached to BOTH group AND circle elements  
**Result**: Multiple mousedown events ‚Üí Timer constantly resets  
**Fix**: Attach handler ONLY to group element

### Bug #2: Handler Tracking (CRITICAL!)
**Problem**: Used `data-combat-dial-enabled` attribute to track handlers  
**Result**: After animation creates NEW element, attribute check blocks re-attachment!  
**Fix**: Use `element._combatDialHandlers` property instead (element-specific)

## Files Modified
- `index.html` - Combat Dial handler system

## Recent Improvements (Prompt 4)
1. ‚úÖ **Spinner separators** - Black lines between same-color segments (still debugging visibility)
2. ‚úÖ **Enhanced logging** - Shows coordinates and cancellation reasons

## Recent Fixes (Evening Session - Oct 14, 7:32 PM)
3. ‚úÖ **Blue move behavior** - Fixed Blue moves to be defensive (draw) instead of offensive (knockout)

### Bug #3: Blue Moves Knocking Out Opponents
**Problem**: Venusaur's "Protect" (Blue) move was knocking out opponents  
**Expected**: Blue moves are DEFENSIVE - they protect from knockout but don't knock out opponent  
**Root Cause**: `determineBattleWinner()` had Blue as highest priority that "beats everything"  
**Fix**: Changed Blue logic to always return 'draw' (no knockout for either side)  
**Files Changed**: `index.html` lines 19889-19895

## Next Steps
1. **IMPORTANT:** Test hold on FIELD robots after they move (not bench!)
2. Field robot coordinates are ~(200-213, 300-460)
3. Bench robots are ~(40-70, 60-700) - you were testing these!
4. Add visual "loading" indicator during hold (optional)
5. Verify on both touch and mouse devices
