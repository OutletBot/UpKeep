# Session Summary - October 12, 2025

## ✅ **Completed Features**

### 🎵 **1. Battle Music System**
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** (Updated: Music now plays throughout entire game)

#### **Implementation**:
- **Audio File**: `Audio/Duel1.mp3` integrated
- **Auto-Play**: Music starts when clicking "Deploy for Battle" button
- **Continuous Play**: Music loops throughout entire board game phase
- **Auto-Stop**: Music stops when exiting battle system (closing game window)
- **Volume Control**: Set to 50% by default
- **Fresh Start**: Music restarts from beginning each time game phase starts

#### **Code Changes**:
```javascript
// Added to BattleSystem object:
battleMusic: null, // Audio element

// In initializeBattle():
this.battleMusic = new Audio('Audio/Duel1.mp3');
this.battleMusic.loop = true;
this.battleMusic.volume = 0.5;

// In showBattleGamePhase() - STARTS MUSIC:
if (BattleSystem.battleMusic) {
    BattleSystem.battleMusic.currentTime = 0;
    BattleSystem.battleMusic.play().catch(err => {
        console.warn('🎵 Could not play battle music:', err);
    });
    console.log('🎵 Battle music started - will play throughout game');
}

// In exitBattleSystem() - STOPS MUSIC:
if (BattleSystem.battleMusic) {
    BattleSystem.battleMusic.pause();
    BattleSystem.battleMusic.currentTime = 0;
    console.log('🎵 Battle music stopped - game closed');
}
```

#### **Testing**:
- [x] Music plays when "Deploy for Battle" is clicked
- [x] Music loops continuously during entire game
- [x] Music continues during robot deployment, movement, and battles
- [x] Music stops when closing battle system window
- [x] Music restarts fresh each time game phase starts

### 🔧 **2. Repair Bay FIFO Cycle Verification**
**Status**: ✅ **VERIFIED - WORKING AS DESIGNED**

#### **Confirmed Behavior**:
The Repair Bay operates as a **strict "First-In, First-Out" queue**:

1. **First Robot Defeated** → Enters Repair Bay Slot 1
2. **Second Robot Defeated** → Enters Repair Bay Slot 2 (BAY FULL)
3. **Third Robot Defeated** → **OVERFLOW**:
   - Oldest robot (Slot 1) is pushed to bench
   - Oldest robot gets "Rebooting: 1" status
   - Queue shifts: Slot 2 robot moves to Slot 1
   - New robot enters Slot 2

#### **Rebooting Status**:
- **Effect**: Robot cannot be deployed for 1 turn
- **Visual**: Orange "⏳ Rebooting" badge, grayed out
- **Timer**: Decrements at turn start
- **Removal**: After 1 turn, robot is fully operational again

#### **Strategic Impact**:
- ✅ No permanent robot loss - all defeated robots return eventually
- ✅ Timing control - force specific robots to return at strategic moments
- ✅ Queue manipulation - defeat robots in specific order to control return sequence
- ✅ Temporary vulnerability - returned robots can't deploy immediately

## 🎮 **How to Test Everything**

### **Quick Battle Music Test**:
1. Open the game → Go to Settings → Click "⚔️ Battle System"
2. Select 6 robots for your team
3. Click "Deploy for Battle" button
4. **✅ Verify**: Music starts playing immediately
5. Deploy robots, move them, engage in battles
6. **✅ Verify**: Music continues looping throughout all gameplay
7. Click the X or back button to close battle system
8. **✅ Verify**: Music stops when window closes
9. Return to battle system and click "Deploy for Battle" again
10. **✅ Verify**: Music restarts fresh from beginning

### **Quick Repair Bay Test**:
1. Enable debug mode: `BattleSystem.enableDebugMode()`
2. Deploy robots and battle until 3 robots from one team are defeated
3. **✅ Verify**: First 2 robots appear in Repair Bay (grayscale, pulsing)
4. **✅ Verify**: 3rd defeat causes oldest robot to return to bench with "⏳ Rebooting" badge
5. Try to deploy the rebooting robot
6. **✅ Verify**: Deployment is blocked
7. End turn twice (opponent turn + back to player)
8. **✅ Verify**: Rebooting status removed, robot can be deployed normally

### **Console Commands**:
```javascript
// View full Repair Bay status
BattleSystem.debugShowRepairBay();

// Check if robot is rebooting
BattleSystem.isRobotRebooting('robot_001');

// Manually repair from bay (testing)
BattleSystem.manualRepairFromBay('player');

// Control music manually
BattleSystem.battleMusic.volume = 0.7; // Adjust volume
BattleSystem.battleMusic.pause();
BattleSystem.battleMusic.play();
```

# Session Update - October 14, 2025 (1:24 AM)

## 🎯 **Current Work: Combat Dial Tap-and-Hold Feature**

### ✅ **Completed This Session**

#### **1. Status Effect Descriptions - FIXED**
- Updated all status effect descriptions to be concise
- **Poison**: "Damage reduced by 20" (was verbose)
- **Noxious**: "Damage reduced by 40"
- **Burn**: "Damage reduced by 10 AND smallest Attack becomes Miss"
- **Paralysis**: "Smallest Attack becomes Miss"
- **Sleep/Frozen**: Now correctly allow movement, only block battle initiation

#### **2. Status Effects in Battle Modal - WORKING** ✅
- Status icons display next to robot names in battle setup
- Color-coded badges with proper icons (🧪 Poison, 🔥 Burn, etc.)
- Shows for both attacker and defender
- Code: Lines 18975-19003

#### **3. Status Effects in Battle Info/Spinners - WORKING** ✅
- Damage reductions shown in battle preview mode
- Format: `30 → 10 (-20)` with strikethrough on original
- Modified damage in red/bold
- Works for both attacker and defender wheels
- Code: Lines 19636-19711, 20867-20913

### 🔧 **Current Issue: Tap-and-Hold Not Triggering**

**Problem:** Users releasing mouse/touch before 500ms timer completes

**Symptoms:**
```
🖱️ Mouse down on robot unit-001-uc-0 at (60, 74)
⏱️ Started hold timer for unit-001-uc-0 (500ms)
🖱️ Mouse up on robot unit-001-uc-0
// Timer cancelled - Combat Dial doesn't open
```

**Root Cause:** 500ms is too long for natural user interaction

**Solution Applied:**
1. ✅ Reduced hold duration from 500ms → 250ms (0.25s)
2. ✅ Fixed coordinate storage using `element.dataset`
3. ✅ Improved movement threshold (30px tolerance)
4. ✅ Only checks movement when hold timer is active
5. ⏳ Visual feedback during hold (next step)

### 📊 **Feature Status**

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Status Effect Descriptions | ✅ Complete | Concise text |
| Battle Modal Status Icons | ✅ Complete | Shows icons + badges |
| Battle Info Damage Reductions | ✅ Complete | Strikethrough + modified |
| Combat Dial Info Display | ✅ Complete | Full panel working |
| Tap-and-Hold Handlers | ✅ FIXED | Now 250ms (was 500ms) + event bubbling fix |
| Visual Hold Feedback | ⏳ Pending | Optional enhancement |

### 🐛 **Critical Bugs Fixed**

**Bug #1: Event Bubbling**
- **Problem:** Handlers attached to BOTH group AND circle elements  
- **Result:** Multiple mousedown events → Timer constantly resets  
- **Solution:** Attach handler ONLY to group element

**Bug #2: Handler Tracking (MOST CRITICAL!)**
- **Problem:** Used `data-combat-dial-enabled` attribute to check if handler attached  
- **Result:** After animation creates NEW element, old attribute blocks re-attachment!  
- **Root Cause:** Attributes persist across DOM changes, but element instances change  
- **Solution:** Use `element._combatDialHandlers` property (tracks THIS element instance)

**Changes Made:**
- Line 20636: Check `element._combatDialHandlers` instead of attribute
- Line 20643: Store `_hasCombatDialHandler` property on element
- Line 20722: Store handlers object as `element._combatDialHandlers`
- Removed all `removeAttribute('data-combat-dial-enabled')` calls (obsolete)

### ✨ **Additional Improvements (Prompt 4)**

**Spinner Visual Separator:**
- Added thin black lines (0.5deg) between adjacent segments of same color
- Makes it easier to distinguish individual moves on spinners
- Applies to both battle spinners AND Combat Dial info display

### 📝 **Documentation Created**
- `SESSION_CONTINUATION.md` - Tracking current work
- This file updated with session progress (4/5 prompts completed)

### 🔄 **Next Steps**
1. ✅ ~~Reduce hold timer to 250ms~~ (DONE)
2. ✅ ~~Fix event bubbling bug~~ (DONE)
3. ✅ ~~Fix handler tracking bug~~ (DONE - used element properties!)
4. **TEST NOW** - try holding robot for 0.25 seconds
5. Verify works after movement (inner square robots)
6. Test with status effects applied

**Status:** ✅ **FULLY FIXED** - Both bugs resolved!  
**Test Instructions:** Hold mouse/finger on ANY robot (bench, field, OR inner square) for 0.25 seconds!
