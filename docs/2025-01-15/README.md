# Psychic Shove Implementation - Session Summary

**Date:** January 15, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE  
**Feature:** Psychic Shove special move with chain knockback and Wait status

---

## üéØ Objective Achieved

Successfully implemented the **Psychic Shove** special move for Mewtwo and other Pok√©mon, including:

1. ‚úÖ Knockback mechanics (straight-line push away from winner)
2. ‚úÖ Chain collision system (multiple robots pushed in sequence)
3. ‚úÖ Wait status application (all affected robots lose 1 turn)
4. ‚úÖ Friendly fire (Wait applies to ALL teams, including allies)
5. ‚úÖ Immovable Object scenario (effect fails if path completely blocked)
6. ‚úÖ Visual feedback (animated knockback with status indicators)

---

## üìã What Psychic Shove Does

### Move Description
> "The battle opponent is knocked as far back as possible in a straight line. All affected Pok√©mon gain Wait."

### Mechanics
1. **Winner activates the move** (not the attacker - whoever wins the battle)
2. **Loser is knocked back** in a straight line away from the winner
3. **Chain knockback:** Any robots in the path are also pushed back
4. **Wait status:** ALL robots that moved (including friendly fire) gain Wait for 1 turn
5. **Immovable Object:** If entire path is blocked, NO robots move and NO Wait is applied

### Key Rules
- **"As far back as possible"** = if distance is ZERO (no empty space), effect FAILS
- **"All affected Pok√©mon"** = only robots that ACTUALLY MOVED
- **Wait duration:** 1 turn (expires at end of affected player's turn)
- **Friendly fire:** Wait applies to BOTH teams (strategic risk!)

## üóÇÔ∏è Files Modified

### Primary File
- **`index.html`** (lines 21610-21830 approximately)
  - `handlePsychicShove()` - Main orchestration function
  - `calculateKnockbackPath()` - Pathfinding in straight line
  - `executeKnockback()` - Movement execution with chain collisions
  - Status effect system integration

### Key Functions

#### 1. `handlePsychicShove(winnerPointId, loserPointId, result)`
**Location:** ~line 21612  
**Purpose:** Orchestrates the entire Psychic Shove effect

**Parameters:**
- `winnerPointId` - Position of battle winner (who activated the move)
- `loserPointId` - Position of battle loser (target to be knocked back)
- `result` - Battle result object with attacker/defender info

**Flow:**
1. Calculate knockback path away from winner
2. Execute knockback with chain collisions
3. Apply Wait status to all affected robots
4. Handle failure cases (no path, path blocked)

#### 2. `calculateKnockbackPath(fromPointId, targetPointId)`
**Location:** ~line 21644  
**Purpose:** Calculate straight-line knockback path using board connections

**Algorithm:**
1. Calculate direction vector (target - winner)
2. Use dot product to score each connected point
3. Build path by selecting highest-scoring connections
4. Stop at board edge or when no valid connections exist

**Returns:** Array of point objects `[{id: 'point-left-2'}, {id: 'point-left-3'}, ...]`

#### 3. `executeKnockback(startPointId, knockbackPath)`
**Location:** ~line 21718  
**Purpose:** Move robots with chain collision handling

**Algorithm:**
1. Build chain of ALL robots (initial target + robots in path)
2. Check for Immovable Object (entire path blocked)
3. Move robots from BACK TO FRONT (farthest first)
4. Each robot moves into space vacated by next robot
5. Track all moved robots for Wait status application

**Returns:** Array of affected robot objects with old/new positions

---

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Direction Vector & Dot Product
```javascript
// Calculate direction from winner to loser
const dx = targetPoint.x - fromPoint.x;
const dy = targetPoint.y - fromPoint.y;
const magnitude = Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
const dirX = dx / magnitude;
const dirY = dy / magnitude;

// Score each connection using dot product
const connectedPoint = this.getPointById(connectionId);
const vecX = connectedPoint.x - currentPoint.x;
const vecY = connectedPoint.y - currentPoint.y;
const dotProduct = (vecX * dirX + vecY * dirY) * 100;
```

**Why dot product?**
- Measures alignment with knockback direction
- Positive = same direction (good)
- Negative = opposite direction (bad)
- Zero = perpendicular (neutral)

### Chain Knockback Order
**CRITICAL:** Robots MUST move from back-to-front!

**Wrong order (old bug):**
```
1. Move initial target first ‚Üí FAILS (destination occupied)
2. Move chain robots ‚Üí Never happens
```

**Correct order:**
```
1. Move farthest robot to first empty space
2. Move second-farthest to where farthest WAS
3. Move initial target to where second-farthest WAS
```

### Immovable Object Detection
```javascript
// Check if ANY empty space exists in path
let hasEmptySpace = false;
for (let i = 0; i < knockbackPath.length; i++) {
    const pathPoint = this.getPointById(knockbackPath[i].id);
    if (!pathPoint.robot) {
        hasEmptySpace = true;
        break;
    }
}

if (!hasEmptySpace) {
    // Effect FAILS - no movement, no Wait
    return [];
}
```

### Wait Status Application
```javascript
// Only apply Wait to robots that ACTUALLY MOVED
for (const robotInfo of affectedRobots) {
    this.applyStatusEffect(robotInfo.newPointId, 'waiting');
}
```

**Wait status definition (already existed in codebase):**
```javascript
'waiting': {
    name: 'Wait',
    turnsRemaining: 1,
    autoExpires: true,
    preventsMovement: true,
    preventsAttack: true,
    preventsAbilities: true
}
```

---

## üêõ Bugs Fixed During Implementation

### Bug 1: Wrong Robot Being Knocked Back
**Problem:** Defender was always knocked back, but should be the LOSER  
**Cause:** Parameter naming confusion (attacker/defender vs winner/loser)  
**Fix:** Changed function signature to accept `winnerPointId, loserPointId`

### Bug 2: Parameter Double-Conversion
**Problem:** `handlePsychicShove` received winner/loser but treated them as attacker/defender  
**Cause:** Function recalculated winner/loser using `result.winner`, reversing the values  
**Fix:** Removed recalculation, use parameters directly

### Bug 3: Chain Robots Not Moving
**Problem:** Initial target never moved when chain existed  
**Cause:** Moved chain robots first, then tried to move target into occupied space  
**Fix:** Completely rewrote algorithm to move back-to-front

### Bug 4: `updateRobotStatusVisuals` Error
**Problem:** Function name typo causing battle modal to freeze  
**Cause:** Called non-existent function  
**Fix:** Changed to `updateRobotStatusIndicators(pointId, robotId)`

### Bug 5: Null Point in Path
**Problem:** `pathPoint is null` error during knockback  
**Cause:** Path included invalid point IDs  
**Fix:** Added validation in `calculateKnockbackPath`

### Immovable Object Failure
```
üß† Psychic Shove: Bulbasaur at point-left-1 knocked back by winner at entry-top-left
üìê Knockback direction from entry-top-left to point-left-1: (0.00, 1.00)
üìç Knockback path from point-left-1: ['point-left-2', 'point-left-3', 'entry-bottom-left']

üîó Chain of 4 robots to move
üõë IMMOVABLE OBJECT: Entire knockback path is blocked - no robots can move
   Path checked: point-left-2 ‚Üí point-left-3 ‚Üí entry-bottom-left
   All spaces occupied - "as far back as possible" = ZERO distance
   ‚ùå Psychic Shove effect FAILS - no robots affected, no Wait applied

üõë Psychic Shove FAILED: Path completely blocked - no robots moved
   "As far back as possible" = ZERO distance
   No robots affected ‚Üí No Wait status applied
```

## üéÆ Integration with Existing Systems

### Battle System
- Integrated into `handleSpecialEffect()` function
- Triggered when winner's move is "Psychic Shove"
- Receives battle result with winner/loser information

### Status Effect System
- Uses existing `applyStatusEffect(pointId, 'waiting')` function
- Wait status already defined in `statusEffects` object
- Automatic expiration handled by turn management

### Movement System
- Uses existing `moveRobotForKnockback()` function
- Respects board connections and pathfinding
- Animated movement with visual feedback

### Turn Management
- Wait status expires at end of affected player's turn
- Prevents movement, attack, and abilities while active
- Visual indicators show Wait status on affected robots

---

## üîÆ Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Sound effects** for knockback impact
2. **Particle effects** for chain collisions
3. **Camera shake** for dramatic effect
4. **Damage on collision** (if hitting wall/edge)

### Other Special Moves
The framework is now in place for other knockback/displacement moves:
- **Annihilate** (move attacker 2 steps away)
- **Whirlwind** (swap positions)
- **Teleport** (move to any empty space)

---

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

- [x] Correct robot is knocked back (loser, not defender)
- [x] Knockback follows straight line away from winner
- [x] Chain knockback works (multiple robots pushed)
- [x] Wait status applied to all moved robots
- [x] Friendly fire works (Wait applies to all teams)
- [x] Immovable Object scenario handled correctly
- [x] Visual feedback shows knockback animation
- [x] Status indicators display Wait status
- [x] Wait expires after 1 turn
- [x] No crashes or errors during execution

---

## üìù Notes for Future Sessions

### If Continuing This Work
1. **Test thoroughly** with various board configurations
2. **Monitor performance** with long chain knockbacks
3. **Check edge cases** (corners, dead ends, loops)
4. **Verify AI behavior** when Wait status is active

### If Implementing Similar Features
1. **Study the knockback algorithm** - it's reusable
2. **Use dot product** for directional pathfinding
3. **Always move back-to-front** for chain effects
4. **Check for Immovable Object** before moving anything
5. **Only affect robots that actually moved**

# Psycho Cut Bonus Spin Mechanic - Implementation Summary

**Date:** January 15, 2025 (Later Session)  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE  
**Feature:** Psycho Cut bonus spin with conditional +50 damage boost

---

## üéØ Objective Achieved

Successfully implemented the **Psycho Cut** bonus spin mechanic for Mewtwo, including:

1. ‚úÖ Automatic bonus spin trigger when Psycho Cut is spun
2. ‚úÖ Animated second wheel spin with visual feedback
3. ‚úÖ Conditional +50 damage bonus (70 ‚Üí 120 damage)
4. ‚úÖ Visual feedback system ("BONUS SPIN!", "+50 DAMAGE!")
5. ‚úÖ Comprehensive logging for debugging
6. ‚úÖ Support for both attacker and defender
7. ‚úÖ Proper animation sequencing and timing

---

## üìã What Psycho Cut Does

### Move Description
> **"Spin again - if Psycho Cut is spun, it deals +50 damage"**

### Mechanics - THE CORRECTED VERSION
1. **Initial Spin:** Robot spins and lands on Psycho Cut (70 base damage)
2. **Bonus Roll Trigger:** System immediately recognizes the special move
3. **Visual Announcement:** "üåÄ BONUS SPIN!" appears over the wheel (magenta)
4. **Second Spin:** The wheel automatically spins again
5. **Conditional Check:**
   - ‚ú® **SUCCESS:** Bonus spin lands on Psycho Cut ‚Üí +50 damage (120 total)
   - ‚ùå **FAILURE:** Bonus spin lands on anything else ‚Üí Original Psycho Cut used (70 damage)
6. **Battle Resolution:** Battle continues with the appropriate damage value

### Key Rules
- **Baseline Attack:** Psycho Cut ALWAYS provides 70 damage minimum
- **Bonus Ignored:** If second spin is NOT Psycho Cut, result is completely discarded
- **Power Boost:** Only applies if BOTH spins land on Psycho Cut (~17.4% chance)
- **No Miss Risk:** Failed bonus spin doesn't change the original move

---

## üîß Technical Implementation

### File Modified
- **`index.html`** - Lines 20882-21139

### Key Functions & Logic

#### Location in Code Flow
```javascript
simulateDataDiskBattleWithAnimation() {
    // 1. Determine initial spins (20840-20856)
    // 2. Apply status effects (20887-20899)
    // 3. Build wheel visuals (20901-20907)
    // 4. Animate initial spins (20910-20935)
    // 5. Show move names (20937-20942)
    // 6. ‚ú® CHECK FOR PSYCHO CUT (20944-21136)
    // 7. Continue to battle resolution
}
```

#### Psycho Cut Detection & Execution
```javascript
// Check if attacker spun Psycho Cut
if (attackerSpin.moveName === 'Psycho Cut') {
    // Get team info
    const attackerTeamForLog = this.currentBattle.attackerTeam;
    
    // Show "BONUS SPIN!" flash
    this.removeMoveFlashes();
    this.showMoveFlash('attackerWheelContainer', 'üåÄ BONUS SPIN!', 'Special');
    await this.delay(800);
    
    // Execute bonus spin
    let bonusSpinData = this.spinWheelWithPosition(attacker.wheel);
    const bonusSpin = bonusSpinData.segment;
    
    // Calculate rotation (+1440deg for extra visual effect)
    const bonusRotation = this.calculateWheelRotation(
        attacker.wheel, 
        bonusSpinData.spinPosition
    ) + 1440;
    
    // Animate bonus spin
    attackerWheel.style.transform = `rotate(${bonusRotation}deg)`;
    await this.delay(2000);
    
    // Check result and apply bonus
    if (bonusSpin.moveName === 'Psycho Cut') {
        // JACKPOT!
        attackerSpin.damage = 120;
        this.showMoveFlash('attackerWheelContainer', '‚ö° +50 DAMAGE!', 'Boost');
        await this.delay(1200);
    } else {
        // Failed - keep original
        this.showMoveFlash('attackerWheelContainer', attackerSpin.moveName, attackerSpin.moveType);
        await this.delay(800);
    }
}
```

### Visual Feedback System

#### New Color Types Added
```javascript
getMoveTypeColor(moveType) {
    const colors = {
        'special': '#ff00ff',  // Magenta for "BONUS SPIN!"
        'boost': '#00ff00'     // Bright green for "+50 DAMAGE!"
    };
}
```

#### Flash Sequence
1. **Initial Move Flash** - "Psycho Cut" (white, 400ms)
2. **Bonus Announcement** - "üåÄ BONUS SPIN!" (magenta, 800ms)
3. **Wheel Animation** - Second spin (2000ms)
4. **Outcome Flash:**
   - Success: "‚ö° +50 DAMAGE!" (green, 1200ms)
   - Failure: "Psycho Cut" (white, 800ms)

---

## üêõ Bugs Fixed During Implementation

### Bug 1: Scope Error - Undefined Variables (CRITICAL)
**Error:** `ReferenceError: can't access lexical declaration 'defenderTeam' before initialization`

**Problem:** Using `attackerTeam` and `defenderTeam` variables before they were declared

**Location:** Line 21054 (original code)

**Cause:** 
- Variables declared at line 21157-21158
- Psycho Cut code tried to use them at line 20946 (before declaration)

**Fix:**
```javascript
// OLD (BROKEN):
this.addToHistory(`...`, 'battle', attackerTeam);  // attackerTeam not declared yet!

// NEW (FIXED):
const attackerTeamForLog = this.currentBattle.attackerTeam;
this.addToHistory(`...`, 'battle', attackerTeamForLog);
```

### Bug 2: Animation Timing - No Wheel Spin Visible (CRITICAL)
**Problem:** Bonus spin executed BEFORE initial wheel animation

**Original Flow (WRONG):**
```
1. Determine spins
2. Check for Psycho Cut ‚ùå
3. Execute bonus spin ‚ùå
4. Build wheel visuals
5. Animate initial spin
```

**Corrected Flow:**
```
1. Determine spins
2. Build wheel visuals
3. Animate initial spin ‚úÖ
4. Show move names ‚úÖ
5. Check for Psycho Cut ‚úÖ
6. Execute bonus spin ‚úÖ
```

**Fix:** Moved entire Psycho Cut logic block to execute AFTER line 20942 (after initial animations complete)

### Bug 3: Code Duplication
**Problem:** Accidentally duplicated 60+ lines of animation code

**Cause:** Incorrect edit placement created duplicate animation setup

**Fix:** Removed duplicate section (lines 21141-21196 in broken version)

---

## üìä Probability Analysis

### Wheel Composition (Mewtwo EX)
- **Psycho Cut:** 40/96 segments = **41.67%**
- **Psychic Shove:** 24/96 segments
- **Miss:** 8/96 segments

### Bonus Spin Probabilities
- **Trigger Psycho Cut initially:** 41.67%
- **Hit Psycho Cut on bonus roll:** 41.67%
- **JACKPOT (both Psycho Cut):** 0.4167 √ó 0.4167 = **17.36%**

### Outcome Distribution
- **70 damage (base):** 82.64%
- **120 damage (boosted):** 17.36%
- **Other moves (Psychic Shove, Miss):** 58.33%

**Strategic Value:** High reliability with exciting power-up potential!

‚úÖ "PSYCHO CUT" flash appears (white)
‚úÖ "üåÄ BONUS SPIN!" flash appears (magenta)
‚úÖ Wheel spins again automatically (2000ms)
‚úÖ "‚ö° +50 DAMAGE!" flash appears (green)
‚úÖ Battle resolves with 120 damage
‚úÖ History log: "Mewtwo's Psycho Cut hits TWICE! +50 damage bonus!"
```

### Test 2: Defender Psycho Cut ‚Üí Failure
```
Setup:

2. Both get bonus spins

Expected:
‚úÖ Attacker bonus spin completes first
‚úÖ Then defender bonus spin executes
‚úÖ Each wheel animates independently
‚úÖ No animation conflicts
‚úÖ Both damage values applied correctly
```

### Test 4: Debugger Mode
```
Setup:
1. Enable debugger panel
2. Force Psycho Cut for player
3. Bonus spin is random (not forced)

## üìù Notes for Future Sessions

### Implementation Notes
1. **Timing is Critical:** Bonus spin MUST execute after initial animations
2. **Scope Management:** Always get team info from `this.currentBattle`
3. **Animation Cleanup:** Use `removeMoveFlashes()` between visual states
4. **Damage Modification:** Modify `attackerSpin.damage` directly before battle resolution

### Testing Recommendations
1. Test with both robots spinning Psycho Cut
2. Verify debugger mode doesn't break bonus spins
3. Check edge case: Psycho Cut vs Psycho Cut battle
4. Monitor performance with multiple consecutive bonus spins
