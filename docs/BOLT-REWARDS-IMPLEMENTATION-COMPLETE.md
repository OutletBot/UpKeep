## 🎉 What Was Implemented

### 1. **Regular Task Completion Rewards**
Tasks now award bolts based on their decay time (difficulty):

| 2-6 days | **25 bolts** | Weekly tasks |
| 1-4 weeks | **50 bolts** | Bi-weekly tasks |
| 1+ months | **100 bolts** | Monthly tasks |
| 3+ months | **200 bolts** | Seasonal tasks |

**Implementation**: `calculateBoltReward(task)` function in `chore-system.js`

---

### 2. **Category 100% Completion Bonuses**
When you complete ALL tasks in a category:

| Category Size | Bonus | First-Time Bonus |
|--------------|-------|------------------|
| Small (1-5 tasks) | **100 bolts** | **200 bolts** |
| Medium (6-10 tasks) | **200 bolts** | **400 bolts** |
| Large (11+ tasks) | **350 bolts** | **700 bolts** |

**Features**:
- First-time completion of any category = **2x bonus** (one-time achievement)
- Tracked via `category.firstCompletionAwarded` flag
- Shows celebration notification with bolt amount

### 3. **Streak Milestone Rewards**
Consistency is rewarded! Streak milestones now award bolts:

| 3 days | **50 bolts** |
| 5 days | **100 bolts** |
| 7 days | **150 bolts** |
| 10 days | **250 bolts** |
| 15 days | **400 bolts** |
| 20 days | **600 bolts** |
| 30 days | **1,000 bolts** |
| 50 days | **2,000 bolts** |
| 100 days | **5,000 bolts** |

**Implementation**: `getStreakMilestoneBoltReward(streak)` in `gamification.js`

### 4. **Self-Care System Updates**
Updated to match the new economy:

| Old | New |
|-----|-----|
| Per task: 2 bolts | **10 bolts** |
| Group bonus: 15 bolts | **75 bolts** |

All UI text updated to reflect new amounts.

### 5. **Enhanced Visual Feedback**
Completely redesigned `showBoltNotification()` function:

**Features**:
- ✨ Bouncy entrance animation with rotation
- 📏 Dynamic sizing based on amount (bigger rewards = bigger notification)
- 🎨 Gradient background with glowing bolt image
- 💬 Optional custom messages (e.g., "🎉 CATEGORY BONUS!")
- ⏱️ 2-second display time with smooth exit animation

- 100+ bolts: Large size (32px font, 36px bolt)
