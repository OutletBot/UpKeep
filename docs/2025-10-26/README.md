## Feature Summary

### What Was Built
- **Compact items display** in Robot Selection modal
- **4 item cards:** Oil Drink, Battery Pack, Mega Battery, Solar Panel
- **Image-only design:** 60×60px cards with 40×40px images
- **Quantity badges:** 18px circle overlay showing owned count
- **Static positioning:** Items stay fixed while robots scroll
- **Visual states:** Full color when owned, grayed out when not

### Why It Matters
- **Mobile-optimized:** Saves valuable screen space on Android
- **User feedback:** Instant visibility of owned items
- **Future-ready:** Prepared for drag-and-drop functionality
- **Consistent design:** Matches app's glassmorphism aesthetic

### Technical Highlights
- Surgical code changes (minimal disruption)
- Clean separation of concerns (items vs robots)
- Performant rendering (no continuous updates)
- Accessible HTML structure (ready for ARIA)
- CSS-only visual states (no JS overhead)

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements ✅
- [x] Items display in Robot Selection modal
- [x] All 4 items show with correct images
- [x] Quantity badges show owned count
- [x] Badge hidden when quantity = 0
- [x] Items stay static while robots scroll
- [x] Visual states work correctly

### Non-Functional Requirements ✅
- [x] Mobile-optimized for Android
- [x] Compact design saves screen space
- [x] Smooth animations and transitions
- [x] Consistent with app aesthetic
- [x] No performance degradation
- [x] Backward compatible with old saves

### User Experience ✅

- [x] Intuitive layout (items at top)
- [x] Quick access to item quantities
- [x] No interference with robot selection
- [x] Touch-friendly sizing

## Lessons Learned

1. **User feedback loop is critical** - Initial implementation had text showing and no quantity badge. Quick iteration based on screenshot feedback led to optimal solution.

2. **Android-first design matters** - Starting with compact, mobile-friendly design saves rework later.

3. **Documentation is investment** - Comprehensive docs created here will save time in future sessions.

4. **Surgical edits prevent bugs** - Minimal changes to existing code means less risk of breaking things.

5. **CSS can do a lot** - Badge visibility controlled purely by CSS (no JS logic needed).
