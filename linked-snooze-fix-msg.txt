CRITICAL FIX: Linked task snooze sync bug

Fixed issue where manually snoozing/unsnoozing tasks in one location would not sync to linked tasks in other locations (e.g., Deep Cleaning - Kitchen not showing as snoozed when Deep Cleaning category shows it snoozed).

Changes:
- Added syncLinkedTaskSnooze() function to sync snooze state across linked tasks
- Updated confirmSnooze() to call syncLinkedTaskSnooze()
- Updated unsnoozeTask() to call syncLinkedTaskSnooze()
- Now manually snoozed/unsnoozed tasks properly sync with their linked counterparts

Files modified: js/chore-system.js

This ensures linked tasks (regular category tasks and group category tasks) maintain consistent snooze state across all views.
