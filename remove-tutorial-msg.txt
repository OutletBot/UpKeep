REMOVE OLD TUTORIAL: Complete removal of buggy tutorial system

Removed all old tutorial code that was appearing unexpectedly:
- Removed tutorial HTML overlay from index.html (lines 2138-2264)
- Removed tutorial JavaScript from chore-system.js (11387-11703)
- Deleted tutorialData object, startUpkeepTutorial(), showTutorialStep()
- Deleted completeTutorial(), skipTutorial(), and all tutorial helper functions

The old tutorial was triggering on page load and interfering with normal operation.
Project is now clean and ready for new robot-guided tutorial implementation.

Files modified:
- index.html: Removed tutorial overlay HTML
- js/chore-system.js: Reduced from 11,695 to 11,403 lines (removed 292 lines of tutorial code)
